SMB2.1 or later is probably fine (and we note SMB2.1 or 3) for most
cases in our mount warning message.

But this FIPS compliance issue reminds me that we should get the other
auth mechanisms working that are 'peer to peer' (so not forced to be
domain joined).   krb5 is great, but Macs support 'peer-to-peer
kerberos' and also SCRAM (RFC 7677) so we could also presumably get
FIPS compliant login for peer-to-peer cases if we implement on or both
of those other auth mechanisms.

Anyone have some Macs or Mac VMs to test against ...?
