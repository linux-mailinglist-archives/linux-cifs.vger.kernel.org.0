I am planning to document this (one reason I made the mount option
name a bit shorter, and tried to make the defaults a bit more
intuitive)

We have workloads where we need this (e.g. cases where they want to
read cache files more aggressively, but safely - but the app closes
the file)

My main short term issue is how to separate it from actimeo which is
unrelated (and somewhat unsafe).

I do plan to update the man page for mount.cifs, but we definitely
need to be able to configure this.  Remember we recently had a bug
where it would have helped investigate it.

The main example I can think of is apps that do:

open/read/close, open/read/close, repeatedly with other clients
occasionally reading or writing the file.   Currently we only cache
the file for 1 second after close. Windows for longer.  Our goal is to
allow this as a performance tuning recommendation for advanced users
until we can pick an optimum value (probably pretty long).

I am fine with documenting this.   My intent was to document it
similar to the following:
- indicate it is an advanced tuning parameter, and its default is fine for many
- indicate that if your apps open many, many files, you may want to
consider setting it smaller if your server is resource constrained, to
put less load on your server (especially if your apps do not
repeatedly reopen the same files over and over)
- indicate that if you have a workload where you want to cache files
for long periods safely, and these files are only occasionally
accessed by other clients, then consider setting it longer.  We have
some example workloads that we were asked about this e.g.
