As far as I understood, pending signal checking only happens if TCP
buffers are full and the kernel is waiting for the free space there to
put SMB packet. Otherwise TCP send returns immediately without waiting
and checking for signals. See:

https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/net/ipv4/tcp.c#L1404
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/net/core/stream.c#L137

There are many situations when there is a non-fatal signal pending
before entering __smb_send_rqst() which won't result in being stuck
waiting for a free space in TCP buffers (most times there is a space).
So, with Ronnie's patch we allow signal to still be pending while we
are sending an SMB packet. If TCP buffers become full in the middle,
then yes, we will return the interrupt failure to the caller.

We most likely should, but I would avoid doing this for stable kernels
to play safe.

Agree. I also think we should amend Ronnies' patch with the change to
the following place:

-----------
/*
* If signal is pending but we have already sent the whole packet to
* the server we need to return success status to allow a corresponding
* mid entry to be kept in the pending requests queue thus allowing
* to handle responses from the server by the client.
*
* If only part of the packet has been sent there is no need to hide
* interrupt because the session will be reconnected anyway, so there
* won't be any response from the server to handle.
*/

if (signal_pending(current) && (total_len !=3D send_length)) {
cifs_dbg(FYI, "signal is pending after attempt to send\n");
rc =3D -EINTR;
        ^^^
        This should be changed to -ERESTARTSYS to allow kernel to
restart a syscall.

}

Even if this is fatal signal, what harm is to return -ERESTARTSYS
unconditionally? It seems that the signal will be handled and the
process will be terminated anyway.
