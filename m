Fully agreed.

This was not on a encrypted session, only mounted with sign option.
(the decryption process happens in the parent if block of the ->receive()
call, thus, taking a different route)

I think I found the problem. In smb2_readv_callback:

----
struct smb_rqst rqst = { .rq_iov = &rdata->iov[1],
                          .rq_nvec = 1,
                          .rq_pages = rdata->pages,
                          .rq_offset = rdata->page_offset,
                          .rq_npages = rdata->nr_pages,
                          .rq_pagesz = rdata->pagesz,
                          .rq_tailsz = rdata->tailsz };
----

This rqst assembling only considers the success case, where there _is_
data in rdata->pages.  Since those fields in rdata are preset and
->pages pre-allocated in send (cifs_send_async_read), there was never an
"obvious" failure here (e.g. NULL deref).

The signature verification fails because it runs over the iov (SMB2
header + read rsp error struct) *and* the pages, where the page data
is valid from the memory POV (allocated, >0 pages, etc), but it's
certainly not from the signature check POV.

I could confirm this by setting only the iov in rqst in the case of
rdata->result != 0. But I'm still evaluating the best way to go through
this
a) by using rdata->result to choose which data to pass to signature
    check, but
b) without breaking any other read scenarios, and
c) without verifying the same message twice

I asked to drop this one because it was the wrong solution, but I think
we'll still need to have a similar check/handling somewhere to prevent a
NULL mid or mid with bogus data from being accessed.

Will report back asap.
