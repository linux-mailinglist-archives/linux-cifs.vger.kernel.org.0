So what I see is that Samba does:

	fallocate(24, FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE|FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE, 0, 4096) =3D 0

for this... but that's not what cifs was asked to do.  Should Samba be usi=
ng
FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE instead?

Also cifs wasn't given FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE, so the caller expected the fil=
e to
be extended - smb3_zero_range(), however, doesn't seem necessarily to get =
this
right.  It seems to allow for KEEP_SIZE not being set by calling
SMB2_set_eof() - but only if the range ends beyond the *local* i_size (whi=
ch
the server doesn't know about yet).

However, we did two pwrites first, which moved the local i_size over.  Thi=
s
means the server's EOF isn't extended - probably correctly, since we haven=
't
saved the data, but the subsequent reads then fail.

In this case, I wonder if the right thing to do is one of the following
options:

 (1) Flush the pagecache before doing proceeding with the fallocate.

 (2) Modify the local pagecache and don't talk to the server at all unless
     there are gaps in the pagecache.

 (3) Keep separate track of where we think the server's EOF is and skip an=
y
     read that's beyond that.

 (4) Treat a read ending in EOF as a read of blank data if it's below the
     local EOF.  I guess that's what we do now.

David
