The trouble with changing to 0x1e is that that would create a
dependency between mount.cifs and the kernel.
And that we would need to upgrade, or downgrade, them in lockstep
which will cause a lot of pain.
Old version of mount.cifs can not talk to new version of kernel and v.v.

I think a better way to handle this would be to use an escape-character for ','.
(and remove all traces of "sep=")
