I would hope that the client would walk its list of connections and
report the local attributes such as source+destination addresses and
ports, along with the transport such as whether it's a TCP or RDMA
connection.

Here, for example (from your patch):

...cifs_dump_channel(struct seq_file *m, int i, struct cifs_chan *chan)
...
+	seq_printf(m, "\n\n\t\tChannel: %d ConnectionId: 0x%llx"
+		   "\n\t\tNumber of credits: %d Dialect 0x%x"
+		   "\n\t\tTCP status: %d Instance: %d"
+		   "\n\t\tLocal Users To Server: %d SecMode: 0x%x Req On Wire: %d"
+		   "\n\t\tIn Send: %d In MaxReq Wait: %d",
+		   i+1, server->conn_id,

I'd strongly suggest digging into the cifs->chan  and adding at least
some of the connection data.

In the second hunk, I believe that's only invoked if CONFIG_CIFS_SMB_DIRECT
is configured, and it doesn't have any of the actual connection
information either, although it does dump the rdma flag.

Bottom line, it seems to me that a more complete picture of
the endpoints would help a lot, especially when multichannel
allows multiple sockets, NICs, and protocols to be involved.

Steve, I believe this list is just the server's response to the
multichannel FSCTL_QUERY_NETWORK_INTERFACE_INFO, which is an
enumeration of *available* server-side interfaces? This is useful,
but isn't helpful to determine which interfaces the client session
is actually using to each one, and from what client NIC ports,
protocols, etc. All it gives is a "CONNECTED" indication to a
single server port. To figure anything else out means groveling
through netstat and guessing at port 445's.

Tom.
