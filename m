I have tried it more times against Windows SMB server and it worked
fine. I created mount point on SMB share, which is pointing to different
filesystem on external disk with FAT and it is working fine on recent
Windows Server 2022 and is working fine also on old Windows 2000. So
seems that this is working fine for at least 25 years.

I tried creating mount point via both GUI "diskmgmt.msc" tool (which
allows to choose disk and then select mount point where to mount it on
other disk e.g. C drive) and also via CLI "mountvol" command in cmd.exe,
similar to UNIX mount command.

If it does not work against Samba then it looks like Samba issue.

When I accessed the mount point then I see a new line appeared in /proc/mounts.

And shell "stat" correctly shows different Device major/minor numbers
for files inside the mount point and on the main share.
