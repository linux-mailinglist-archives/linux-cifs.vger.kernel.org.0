Hello Enzo,

Sorry for the delay in response. To further clarify the use-case it is
not pertaining to the target shares, but concerning the namespace
server that we connect to as part of the initial mount for the domain
based DFS share. Assume an environment with some N number of DCs where
each DC is in their own site, a DFS namespace member for the same
namespace, and the domain resolves to each DC in a round-robin.

Condition #1
For AD client site members that are in the same subnet as the site
local DC, we only ever connect to said DC when mounting a domain based
DFS share.

Condition #2
For AD client site members that are *not* in the same subnet as the
site local DC, we connect to a DC that the domain name resolves to,
site local DC, and then the SMB target. We have a  1/N chance of
connecting to the site local DC initially which is not desirable.

For condition #2, we could be potentially connecting to DCs that could
be prohibitively far geographically and incur a non-trivial delay with
possible timeout. While certainly the appeal of a domain based DFS
mount is the abstraction to know which SMB server to access, condition
#2 can yield mount issues when the AD client does not have the
capacity/opportunity to add a DC to the subnet for whatever reason.
This could include heavily siloed environments, separate teams, or
cross vendor interactions.

I could see a use-case where should the SMB client want to limit which
DCs to connect to, with the intent to exclude non-desirable DCs, a
flag be passed that invokes a CLDAP ping to affect such a change. This
can already be done with a hacky wrapper script, but I am curious as
to what level of interest there would be for a more durable
implementation.

Hope that helps to clarify the situation and please ask any follow-up
questions should you or anyone else have any.

Regards,

Jacob Shivers
