.
check_user_session and get_ksmbd_tcon should not be moved inside
__process_request()
because session id and tree id of related pdu is 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
and 0xFFFFFFFF.

Ah.. You pushed this patch to ksmbd-for-next-pending ?
Sorry for that, my mistake, I will check branch before applying my patch.
