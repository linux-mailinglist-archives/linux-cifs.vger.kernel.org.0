I am not as worried about FIFO and SOCK type being recognized by
older servers (since almost every use case for them would be for them
to be seen (only) by the client - e.g. for mounts to servers that
don't implement reparse points yet), and since they are less
common file types I am willing to let them be unrecognized by
old clients (we can tag them for stable if older distros don't have
them),  but I am concerned about allowing "current clients" to
create empty files for an unusual purpose which could be
confusing/non-intuitive.

And since this change (at least the one to allow FIFOs to be created with "=
sfu"
has been in mainline for a year and also since it uses a more intuitive tag
("LnxFIFO") than the empty one used by very old Windows) the only
clients who would have created these would be already using this newer tag
(older Linux clients couldn't have created such files - there seems more
risk of regression with reverting the change than with continuing with
the Linux client specific tag (at least to the one for FIFOs
since that has been in much longer than the socket one which is recent)

Will discuss with others - opinions welcome.

There is an upcoming SMB3.1.1 test event coming up next week (and the annua=
l
Storage Developer Conference too) so I can see if others have opinions one
way or another on whether to move to empty (or 1 byte) files for
creating fifos/sockets

makes sense - thx
