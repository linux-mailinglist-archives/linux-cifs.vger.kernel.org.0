My initial test of this was to Windows 10, doing ls of the root directory.

During mount as expected I see the initial compounded smb3.1.1
create/query(file_all_info) work and get a directory lease (read
lease) on the root directory

Then doing the ls
I see the expected ls of the root directory query dir return
successfully, but it is a compounded open/query-dir (no lease
requested) not a query dir using the already open root file handle.
We should find a way to allow it to use the root file handle if
possible although perhaps less important when the caching code is
fully working as it will only be requested once.

The next ls though does an open/query but then does stat of all the
files (which is bad, lots of compounded open/query-info/close).  Then
the next ls will do open/query-dir

So the patch set is promising but currently isn't caching the root
directory contents in a way that is recognized by the subsequent ls
commands.   I will try to look at this more this weekend - but let me
know if updated version of the patchset - it will be very, very useful
when we can get this working - very exciting.
