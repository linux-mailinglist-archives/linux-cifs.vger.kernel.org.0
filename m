It is primarily about making sure that applications do not misbehave.
Especially applications or glibc that do pay close attention to  what
errno is when a syscall fails. And where errno drives them how to
handle or manage recovery.

It basically depends on case by case scenario. Are applications
calling this syscall directly or via glibc. If the latter, what errnos
does glibc accept for that syscall and how does it deal with them?
The answer here is what the man page says, because that is what
application and glibc are coded against.
We can not introduce new errno values to userspace.

There may be situations where currently we leak "unexpected" errno
values through syscalls. That would be a bug and we need to fix it.

In cifs.ko we have had very serious bugs in the past where we were
leaking "unexpected" errno values to either glibc or application that
turned what should be a simple recoverable error into a serious hard
Data-Loss failure :-(. By causing glibc/application recovery code to
be "surprised" and to fail recovery. Very sad.

The way imho opinion to prevent confusion to end user is to log
warning with explanation to dmesg or log file.
If user caser, user looks at dmesg/log. If user does not care, that is
fine. As long as we do not "surprise" glibc or application.
We make sure we return only those errnos in the manpage and from there
it is the responsibility of glibc/application to handle it.
