Ok, that makes sense. From the protocol perspective it is reparse point
and so everything related to reparse points applies to it.

Yes.

Make sense.

Windows applications can already check for it there is
GetVolumeInformationA() function for it.

And also applications on Windows can issue directly the syscall to NT
kernel and not use that API at all. It is NtQueryVolumeInformationFile
for FileFsAttributeInformation class.

On Linux this information is currently not exported from kernel to
userspace, but recently is a work to add a missing gap and support for
different attributes and I guess that information about filesystem would
be too. As a first step are being added new syscalls file_getattr() and
file_setattr() (see fs: introduce file_getattr and file_setattr syscalls)

This was an example of two different filesystems where one support
special files and another one does not.

Ok. In this case, it does not matter for the client how the server
stores reparse points. Every filesystem can do it differently. And it is
really out of the scope. The important is the network / transport layer
and how it is used and announced.
