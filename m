I would like to see the output of:

/proc/fs/cifs/DebugData before and after the failure if possible.

In addition, there would be some value in seeing trace information
(e.g start tracing by
"trace-cmd record -e cifs" before the failure and then forward the
debug information displayed by "trace-cmd show" after the failure)
