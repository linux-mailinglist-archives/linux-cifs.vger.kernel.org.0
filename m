I completely agree that email is inefficient, but git is a terrible
way to have a discussion. We should attempt to be sure we have
those, and that everybody has a chance to see the proposals without
having to go to the web five times a day.

Please take this as a request for regular git-send-email updates to
this list, so I can see them if I'm not online. Maybe add a boilerplate
line to direct to the git repo webui. I'm sure a few others will
appreciate it too.

Tom.
