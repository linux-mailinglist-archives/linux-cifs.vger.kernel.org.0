Solaris is dead, dead, dead. We should not resurrect the
warts of that thing in Linux.

I never thought I'd be calling on Christolph Hellwig
to squash such a horror before it emerges, but I'm
  CC:ing him on this email in the hope that he will :-).

Please give real examples of something for which this
is *essential*. Not "could be.. useful".

Hard mode. Windows has yet to find such an example :-).

One more datapoint: "still be able to treat it as a single self-contained
file from an end-user perspective." - please enumerate
every single tool and archiving program that will need
to be changed to treat a file containing alternate data
streams as "a single self-contained file".

I hope they just say no :-).
