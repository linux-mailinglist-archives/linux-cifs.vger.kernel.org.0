I see the point. I wasn't thinking about it from the security
perspective too much and would agree with you on this argument about
data leaks.

The protocol itself is not necessarily unsecured, since in the spec it
calls for enumeration in an "implementation-specific manner"[1]. I
would interpret that as the implementation could enumerate interfaces
as it sees fit to its functional and security perspectives. The spec
only requires the server to always return a list of client-usable
interfaces, that does not need to always be the full interface list.

That being said, from ksmbd's implementation perspective, this
definitely needs to be something to be explicitly configured.

The short answer is: a Windows client requires this flag to be present
to actually utilize RDMA.

Long answer:

Although SMB-Direct (Microsoft speak for SMB over RDMA) protocol
technically is just wrapping SMB packets in RDMA transport, allowing
for a SMB connection to be completely handshaked and established in
RDMA context, without any need for transferring ip packets. This kind
of connection seems to be never happening for the actual client
implementation in Windows.

Under Windows, SMB Direct is only enabled when SMB multichannel is
enabled. And there is no way for the user to specify if they want to
connect to the IPoIB endpoint or RDMA endpoint - the client simply
connects to the ip interface first, uses the aforementioned IOCTL
request to query the RDMA capabilities for all interfaces, and upon
finding usable RDMA-capable interfaces, opens preferred data channels
on RDMA transport to carry the actual data.

As far as I know there is no way from a Windows user's perspective to
modify this behavior and upon disabling SMB multichannel, SMB will
just disable RDMA support and transfer everything over IP. The RDMA
transport is only "automatically upgraded to", no explicit
configurations are available whatsoever.

So if ksmbd does not send out capability flags to indicate the Windows
client to initiate RDMA transport as a side channel, the client will
just keep working with connections on the ip stack and the user can
never utilize RDMA.

To be clear: I would strongly agree that the Windows client's behavior
here is pretty stupid and is just outright dumb design. In configuring
my two-workstation setup utilizing this protocol, the no-config design
of the Windows side has created far more problems than it has solved.
It also somehow brought me here submitting my first kernel patch.
However if we want any interoperability of ksmbd with Windows clients
on the RDMA front, we would need to implement the IOCTL response to
some degree and send out the RDMA capability flags.

My apologies for not making this context earlier, I was too
hyper-focused on the code itself to fall into the classic XY problem
trap.

Disclaimer: all my knowledge and research about windows client is
limited to the edition I have access to (Windows 10 Pro Workstation),
I have no idea if Windows server edition's client is different.

This is related to the long answer to the first question. Basically
using a Windows client the user cannot make decisions to use RDMA or
not, it is not the decision of the server, either - the client will
enumerate the interfaces and make decisions for the user. And due to
the presence of SMB multichannel, the ip interface receiving the
interface enumeration request is not even guaranteed to be the
connected IPoIB interface - the multichannel protocol is designed to
work with service discovery, where it is totally possible that the
initial connection will be established on another data path, before
the client discovers another better path potentially with RDMA
capability. The only way for ksmbd to be fully compatible with these
is to implement the interface enumeration to some degree. Although I
am indeed convinced that this needs to be explicitly configured to
avoid any security risks.
