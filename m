I initially posted this to the Samba mailing list, where it didn't 
receive much attention, but it might be more appropriate for a
CIFS-specific mailing list. Per the subject, this may be an
Ubuntu-specific bug, but I don't have the familiarity with CIFS to
claim this is so and that nothing is wrong with my setup.

---

This is a problem that's plagued us for a while that we haven't been
able to resolve due to the lack of familiarity with cifscreds and keyring
debugging, so I thought I'd ask here to see if there's anything obviously
wrong with our setup, or if there's any cifscreds/keyring debugging
advice that could help us.

We currently use multiuser CIFS mounts on a handful of domain-joined
Ubuntu 16.04 servers to permit users to access CIFS shares with their AD
credentials. The CIFS shares in question are mounted by a separate service
account. Everything has been working as expected on the 16.04 servers:

$ cat /etc/lsb-release

However, with the exact same setup on an 18.04 and 20.04 server, I am
unable to access the CIFS mount after running cifscreds add share:

The following error appears in dmesg whenever I try to interact with
/mnt/share:

[   44.660510] CIFS VFS: signing requested but authenticated as guest
[   44.663053] CIFS VFS: SMB signature verification returned error = -13

[   44.665442] CIFS VFS: cifs_put_smb_ses: Session Logoff failure rc=-13

I can't tell if these mssages are significant or not -- I recall reading
that this was just a change in logging between releases. I tried using
ntlm through ntlmssp for the mount, but none of those protocols resulted
in the mountpoint being accessible by my user (they did however get rid of
the dmesg message). I've tried adjusting other mount options to no avail.
I can recreate this issue on multiple shares across multiple servers.

I found this bug report:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cifs-utils/+bug/1900856

along with this one:

https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=986168

which seem to be similar issues, except with Kerberos authentication. From
the first report, I enabled some more verbose debugging:

$ echo 'module cifs +p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
$ echo 'file fs/cifs/* +p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
$ echo 7 > /proc/fs/cifs/cifsFYI
$ echo 1 > /sys/module/dns_resolver/parameters/debug

Then, when attempting to ls /mnt/share:

/build/linux-Y38gIP/linux-4.15.0/fs/cifs/smb2maperror.c: Mapping SMB2
status code 0xc0000022 to POSIX err -13

Not sure if these messages are meaningful, but I thought I'd include them.

There's been other cifscreds strangeness that we've noticed, like access
to mounts not being immediately revoked when `cifscreds clear[all]`
is ran, but this is the main, easily reproducible issue we've been seeing
that's preventing us from using multiuser on CIFS mounts.

We use Samba DCs on version 4.12.3-8, and the CIFS share hosts are
up-to-date TrueNAS servers.
