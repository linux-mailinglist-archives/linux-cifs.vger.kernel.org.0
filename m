Yes - the reproducer helps.  The bug is easy to reproduce.

I wanted to verify that the succeeding cases are the same that I see:
- works with "cache=3Dnone"
and
- works with "nobrl"
and
- works with "vers=3D1.0"

All other combinations fail ...

Should be straightforward to fix in cifs.ko.  Will look at a fix for
this later today.

Note that the problem with SMB3.1.1 POSIX extensions is a Samba bug -
a serious regression in the server (but trivial fix).  We are waiting
on someone to merge the oneline fix to the server (which we tested out
ok) from David.
