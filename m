I (and many at Microsoft and in Samba team etc.) also have a strong
desire to stop
using the word "CIFS" as it has been associated with some very high profile
attacks, and with the introduction of SMB2.1 support (which was far more
secure) in 2009 no one should be using the very old CIFS dialect
(aka "SMB1" dialect).  So if you are ok with renaming the client dir and module
name - we can gradually stop using the word/name "cifs" except for the
parts of code which really are needed to access the (unfortunately
hundreds of millions of) very old devices which require SMB1 ("CIFS").
We could even build two versions of the module "smb3.ko" which does not
include support for the less secure legacy dialects and "cifs.ko" which does
include it.   Is there a precedent for something similar.

Note that with the introduction of various security features
in SMB3 (then even more security features in SMB3.1.1) it seems like it seemed
confusing to users to tell them "mount -t cifs ..." which was why I
added support
for "mount -t smb3 (to cifs.ko)  in the 4.18 kernel/   but I also
would strongly like to
stop using the word "cifs" in module name going forward, even if it does cause
a little bit of extra work for distros (most of which could be handled
in the mount
helper in any case)

If no objections,  we can start moving most things on
the client to "smb.ko" rather than "cifs.ko" ...

Do you have any objections to me renaming the client's source
directory to "fs/smb3"
(or fs/smb) and fs/smb3_common ...?
