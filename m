Not necessarily, but in any case until Windows supports SMB3.1.1 POSIX
extensions
it is moot point for the change to correctly check if SMB3.1.1 POSIX Extens=
ions
(not just check if the fsattr for supporting reparse points) is set.
Obviously a server
can (and will) support special files with SMB3.1.1 POSIX (emulating
them as reparse points over
the wire, but storing them however the server thinks is best) but some
will not support reparse points
generally (just in the narrow case for SMB3.1.1 POSIX Extensions)

That is not the case to Samba (and presumably to some other servers as
well) although
it may be for Windows.   Windows handles junctions/links pointing to
different drives much
differently than Linux so am not surprised that the behavior differs.
