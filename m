Ah, Okay. Let me think more..

I was sure there won't be any strong comments, as We've used the MIT
Kerberos (krb5-doc) case as an example. If samba is not installed, man
smb.conf show ksmbd's one.

The initial idea was to make the configuration compatible with samba.
Users copy it to ksmbd directory and reuse the smb.conf file they used
in samba as it is. And I have no strong opinion to renaming it to
ksmbd.conf(i.e. man ksmb.conf).  Atte, Any thought about this ?

Is it possible to add it to manpage even though a utility or
configuration file named ksmbd doesn't exist? That is, as if there is
no "man nfs".

Is this command available on all distributions?

Other ksmbd utils are described in README of ksmbd-tools github, so I
did not list them here.
