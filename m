I checked it and seems that both Windows SMB client and Windows SMB
server on Windows Server 2022 filter out this class 64.

Windows SMB client does not send request to server at all and
immediately return error to application which tried to use class 64. And
Windows SMB server returns STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, which indicates that
server recognized it, but filtered it. Older Windows servers returns
STATUS_INVALID_INFO_CLASS which indicates that they did not understand
class 64 at all.

So seems that against Windows SMB implementation, this class 64 is
unusable for now.


Anyway, can somebody ask in Microsoft if they can allow to use
class 64 (FileDispositionInformationEx) and class 65
(FileRenameInformationEx) in their SMB client and server?
This would really help with Linux/POSIX interop, which Windows already
provided for local filesystems.

Steve, are you able to ask somebody in Microsoft for this?
