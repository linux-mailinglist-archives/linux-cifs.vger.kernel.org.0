I've looked into this recently. cifscreds from cifs-utils can already
store/update credentials in keyrings.

I believe this is only used in multiuser mode (-o multiuser).  In that
mode, when a process does a syscall, cifs.ko will try to use a cifs_ses
matching the uid of that process, potentially opening a new one.

To open a new session for that user, cifs.ko looks at the current
process session keyring for that uid credentials. Take a look at
cifs_set_cifscreds(), it's the function that sets the credentials in the
volume about to be connected to.

* the key is of type "logon",
* description is "cifs:<mode>:<host>" where mode determines what host is
  ('a' for an ip address, 'd' for a domain).
* value is "<user>:<password>"

[ side-note on that keyring: it is the process session keyring. So you
need to make sure the keyring is created when the user first logs in the
system (i.e. via pam), otherwise cifscreds will create it, and since it
is the only user, will destroy it when cifscreds exits (refcount reaches
zero).  I don't know why it was decided to use the session keyring, I
feel like we should make this keyring "global" instead of per session,
it would be easier to setup and update but I don't know the security
implications. (If anyone knows please share) ]

In any case, I think we should try to update
cifs_ses->{user_name,password} before re-opening a session by looking at
this keyring.

Cheers,
