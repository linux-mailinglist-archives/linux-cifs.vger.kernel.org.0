Were you able to confirm that the problem started after 6.6.0 but
regressed before 6.6.9 - any chance of narrowing the regression down
by bisection?

which is in the middle of a page in the cache.

 cached page.

he first portion of what it thought was the final partial page, and marks a=
ll pages as clean.

es and skips the beginning of the second write because it thinks that page =
is clean. The following page is a completely new page and is dirty, so it s=

always at the beginning of our application's write and corrects itself at t=
