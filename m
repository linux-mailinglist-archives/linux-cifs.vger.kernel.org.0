I think that's okay. AFAIK, that's only used for
debugging/troubleshooting purposes. So it doesn't need to be a 100%
accurate.

I initially did not have the utsname changes. That idea was an afterthought.
Sure. I'll update the patch to fix this.

Noted.

That's a good idea. Let me explore that too.
