Probably not because most of the time these settings do not really
work, and often, when you increase them you make things worse.

I think you want to implement something like when a cached directory
is re-opened then the timeout is reset so that
hot directories will remain in the cache longer. Which is what you
want. You want hot data in the case.

On the other hand, you want cold data to expire as quickly as
possible, because cache that is held up by cold data can not
be used to store hot data until the cold data has expired from the
cache. So you want this timer as short as possible.
The shortest possible timeout without it also expiring out hot data.

Shorter timeouts and quicker expunge oc cache =3D=3D better performance.
It might not sound intuitively but I can show with a simple example.

Assume your cache has 10 slots to store a directory.
Assume you have 1000 cold directories that are accessed relatively infreque=
ntly.
Assume you have 1 directory that is hot and is accessed 10 times more
frequently than a cold directory.

We now changed the timeout to 60 seconds. This means any cold
directory that enters the cache will sit in the cache and block that
entry for 60 seconds
until it is cleared and something else can use that cache slot.
This is akin a model where every 60 seconds you have a lottery where
10 directories will win entry to the cache.
What is the probability that a hot directory wins the lottery and
becomes cached?
In this example it is 1%  because the access to the hot directory is
only 1% of all access.
All the cold directories have just a 0.1% chance of becomming cached
but since there are so  many of them they will still dominate.
(The problem we have to solve now is to get the hot directory into the
cache as fast as possible and to get it to remain in cache for as long
as possible.)

On average thus we will have to wait 50 iterations until the hot
directory will even enter the cache for the first time,  or it will on
average take 50 minutes
before the hot directory is even cached.
If we had left the original 30 second timeout it would "only" have
taken 25 minutes on average to get this directory into the cache.
This kind of suggests that even 30 seconds would be way to big for
this example and maybe we should use 10 seconds, or less.

You want hot directories in the cache for as long as possible. A good
way to do this is to make them sticky, so that if they are frequently
accessed while
cached, make them sticky so they do not expire as easily from the cache.
On the other hand, any cold directory you want to expire from the
cache as fast as possible since every time you hold a cold directory
in cache, that part of the cache becomes
useless and wasted.  You do this by, for example, setting this timeout
as low as possible. So they are kicked out as soon as possible.
