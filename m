You make a good point. I did think about this.
There are several cases here.
1. If the subsequent open is from another client B: This would force
the server to send a lease break to this client A. But since the
client has closed all local data for the handle (only the server close
is pending), the lease break would go unrecognized. That is not a good
thing to do. So we'll need to keep zombie handles lying around (and in
the list) till the file is actually closed on the server. We just need
to make sure we mark these handles as zombies so future opens to the
file do not reuse this handle.
2. If the subsequent open is from the same client A: If the client
cannot find the handle, it can try an open on the server. However,
that open could fail depending on the open mode by earlier handle. So
I think we could use the above idea of zombie handles here too, where
the new opens could be failed with a retriable error (EAGAIN?).

Do you see a problem with this approach?
