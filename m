Well as Tom said, it gets very confusing to have the
same name config file.

The file system attributes etc. certainly should be
the same, to allow a user to swap between the two
servers based on need and not lose any meta-data.

But as the features diverge, trying to keep a common
config will get harder and harder.

Better to take the pain now, rather than try and
postpone for later. It'll hurt *worse* later :-).
