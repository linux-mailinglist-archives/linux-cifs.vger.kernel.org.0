Hi Shyam,

I 100% agree with your proposed changes. I came up with an idea and got
to draw a diagram a while ago that would handle multichannel connections
in a similar way you propose here.

https://exis.tech/cifs-multicore-multichannel.png

The main idea is to have the 'channels' (sockets) pool for a particular
server, but also create submission/receiving queues (SQ/RQ) (similar to NVMe
and io_uring) for each online CPU.  Then each CPU/queue is free to send
to any of the available channels, based on whatever algorithm is chosen
(RR, free channel, fastest NIC, etc).

I still haven't got time to design the receiving flow, but it shouldn't
change much from the reverse of the sending side.

Of course, there's a lot to improve/fix in that design, but something I
thought would enhance cifs multichannel performance a lot.

I've discussed this idea with Paulo a while back, and he already
provided me with great improvements/fixes for this.  Since I still
haven't got the time to work on it, I hope this to serve as inspiration.


Cheers,

Enzo
