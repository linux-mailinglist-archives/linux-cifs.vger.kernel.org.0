I was doing some more reading up on this today. And it does look like
our ChannelSequence operations should be okay.
The spec recommends that each session for a given server maintains
it's ChannelSequence. We use the channel_sequence_num on the primary
channel. So we are good that way.

However, a few other things that I observed about what the spec says
about how the server implements the ChannelSequence (3.3.5.2.10
Verifying the Channel Sequence Number):
1. The ChannelSequence need not be incremented on each reconnection of
any channel. It needs to be incremented only when all the channels are
down. I can create a follow on patch for this.
2. If the server sees that the ChannelSequence for a request is not
the latest, then it may return STATUS_FILE_NOT_AVAILABLE. The client
should be prepared to handle this by replaying the request again.
3. If we carelessly increment the channel_sequence_number, more
requests can start failing with STATUS_FILE_NOT_AVAILABLE. So #1 and
#2 become more important to implement.
4. >> which should take precedence over an older queued write to the
same offset that has a lower sequence number
I'm not sure that this is the correct assumption. Based on the spec,
it seems to me like ordering of the old queued writes need not be
preserved if the replay bit is not set. If the replay bit is set, it
looks like conflicting writes can result in the later one being
returned STATUS_FILE_NOT_AVAILABLE.
