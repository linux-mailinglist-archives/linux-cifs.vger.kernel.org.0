Thanks so much Steve.  

Kevin can give more info, but no, my understanding is that this was
"always" problematic, the reason it came up now is LibreOffice changed
how it handled file saves, rather than a kernel change.

Even if the fix is to be in the direction that 'breaks' LibreOffice,
that is OK, I have given Kevin a suggestion on using locks ranges
towards the end of the file as a way to regain the desired 'advisory'
semantics, but we wanted to be working on solid ground with consistent,
reliable semantics that don't depend on cache modes. 

Thanks,

Andrew Bartlett
