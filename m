+1 on this. email-based patch workflow is fine when patches
don't go through many iterations or have many people working
on them, but when those things are true a repository-based
workflow is far better (IMHO). Everyone knows how to use
git (these days :-).

It would be good to get to the point where the list is
used as a "release management" tool where patches that
have already been completely reviewed and signed-off
are sent and archived.
