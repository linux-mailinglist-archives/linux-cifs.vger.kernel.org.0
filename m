I think it would make sense to have something like

diff --git a/fs/cifs/transport.c b/fs/cifs/transport.c
index e9abb41aa89b..f7292c14863e 100644
--- a/fs/cifs/transport.c
+++ b/fs/cifs/transport.c
@@ -340,7 +340,7 @@ __smb_send_rqst(struct TCP_Server_Info *server, int num=
_rqst,

 	if (signal_pending(current)) {

-		return -ERESTARTSYS;

so that we allow signal handlers to be executed before restarting
syscalls when receiving non-fatal signals, otherwise -EINTR.
