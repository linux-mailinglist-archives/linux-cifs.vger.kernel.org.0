It just occurred to me that integrating with mount.cifs will not
suffice for a multiuser scenario.
It sounds like we need to modify cifscreds command to have a switch
for cifscreds command; if used in krb5 context, instead of dealing
with kernel keyring, we authenticate with PAM (for add) and call PAM
logoff (for clear).
If users are then missing krb5 tickets (logged in to ssh using private
keys), they can call cifscreds to get the tickets.

@Pavel Shilovsky @Aur=C3=A9lien Aptel Please let me know what you think
about this approach.
If you agree, I'll start working on the patch.

Regards,
Shyam
