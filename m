Indeed yes, my point is that until/unless Microsoft indicates
the new signing context is committed to the protocol, it's
premature to bake it into Linux, or anywhere else. Speaking
from experience, things have been changed or removed at some
very late dates, in fact.

While I have the floor, and just a personal opinion, I feel
there is a huge and confusing proliferation of module options
and mount flags creeping into cifs.ko over time here. Is this
really a good idea?

Tom.
