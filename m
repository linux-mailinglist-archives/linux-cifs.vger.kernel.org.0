Oh, right, even worse -- you want to know the _future_ state of the
iterator before you mutate it (it's kind of the same thing though
if you haven't looked at how the iterator works internally).

The problem is that the other users very much want to refer to the
pre-mutation state.  eg, btrfs:

        while ((nr = readahead_page_batch(rac, pagepool))) {
                u64 contig_start = readahead_pos(rac);
                u64 contig_end = contig_start + readahead_batch_length(rac) - 1;

                contiguous_readpages(pagepool, nr, contig_start, contig_end,
                                &em_cached, &bio_ctrl, &prev_em_start);
        }

The API isn't designed to work the way you want it to work.  So either
we redesign it (... and change all the existing users ...) or you use
it the way that FUSE does, which is admittedly suboptimal, but you're
also saying it's temporary.
