If that is the case, then we don't really have many options left but
to expose the advertisement of rdma-capable flags as a configurable
option from the user space (maybe via sysfs). I am not sure if this
will allow the user to mark an interface as RDMA-capable despite its
incapability, or would the capability check be allowed to be made from
the configuration validation site?

I see, so if I understand this argument correctly, the point is that
even if an IPoIB device *is* guaranteed to have some RDMA support in
the stack (since IPoIB is ULP of an IB device, which always supports
RDMA), it does not necessarily want to expose that capability to its
own ULP in the stacks above, right? However if this is the case, then
what would be the correct way to determine the capability flag from a
ULP?

This check does not work with IPoIB devices. For IPoIB devices
ib_device_get_by_netdev would just return null.

Correct me if I am wrong but I think this API is intended to work with
RDMA/IB transport as ULP of a normal netdev transport (e.g. RoCE,
iWARP). It essentially only performs a lookup of the devices up the
stack, not down the stack, thus not working for IPoIB devices. I feel
this is somehow intended as well since it works inline with the
principle that IPoIB devices should just be treated like a normal
netdev.

This is probably true for the get_netdev verb on ib_device, and the
ib_device_get_netdev API, they are just performing the lookup in
reverse direction.

> And why does it look in the smb_direct_device_list first?

I don't know - this section of code is already here before my patch,
and it confuses me a lot too. It is actually doing the lookup in one
direction and then doing it again in the other direction, probably on
the same mapping. I just left it there during initial patch
submission, just in fear of breaking any strange corner cases.

Thanks,
Kangjing
