When reconnecting or accessing DFS links (cross-server symlinks) the
client opens a new connection to the target server and has to auth
again. Since there are no ways to ask for a password at that moment
(we're in the middle of some syscall) cifs.ko does an upcall to
cifs.upcall and passes the pid of the process who initiated the
syscall. cifs.upcall then reads that proc env (via /proc/<pid>/environ)
and looks for KRB5CCNAME, uses it and returns the required data for
cifs.ko to proceed with the SMB Session Setup.

So it is important to have this env var set if the location of the
credential cache is not the default one. If you do PAM login from
mount.cifs, the env var might be set for that process but it will only
persist in children processes of mount.cifs i.e. most likely none.

I still think this patch is a good idea but we should definitely print
something to the user that things might fail later on, or give
instructions to set the env var in the user shell or something like that.

Mount option sounds good regardless.

The keyring docs have some info on it too but it's still not clear to
me.
