    SMB2.1 would be fine for my purposes, I find it a bit odd though that
my linux server running these changes won't be as capable of detecting
directory changes as an outdated Win7 machine. 

    There are many below-SMB3 speaking devices out in the world right now. 
Probably many below 2.1. 

    You say you want to "encourage users to use SMB3 or later (or at least
SMB2.1)", how does adding SMB3-only support allow users to use SMB2.1?
Say your encouragement of users is taken to heart, and they want to use 
SMB3.
How would those users upgrade the dialect of SMB used in their
machine or device?  I don't know of any easy way to upgrade existing 
devices -
even existing OS's, if a user ran Win7, how would they upgrade the CIFS
drivers to 3.0?

    If it is not possible to upgrade existing devices, then wouldn't that
encouragement boil down to junking the device and buying a new one?

    Doesn't that mean that the linux client won't be able to access 
existing
NAS servers or Win-Client machine running anything other than Win10?  Does
the current version of samba provide full SMB3 support?  If not, doesn't 
that
imply that the client for CIFS won't be able to access or use these features
from another linux server?

    Again, how does implementing SMB3-only, only support SMB2.1 or later?

    If you feel it would be trivial to add such a patch, wouldn't you be in
the position of, probably, having the most knowledge about the subject 
and be
likely to do the best job without breaking anything else?  Certainly doesn't
mean someone else couldn't but seems riskier than offering a Linux 
client that
would be able to access the widest range of existing devices and 
computers from
the start.

Thanks!
