Sounds good to consider separately.

Ah, yes it's true that with no requests in flight, the wait would be
unbounded, and uncertain to gain credits even then. I think that is
well worth capturing in a code comment where the failure is returned.

It's still a concern that large requests may fall victim to being
locked out by small ones, in the low-credit case. A "scheduler", or
at least a credit reservation, would seem important in future. Or,
as mentioned, modifying the requests to consume fewer credits each.

It's easy to envision a situation where a low-credit server can be
up, but a credit-greedy client might refuse to send it any requests
at all.
