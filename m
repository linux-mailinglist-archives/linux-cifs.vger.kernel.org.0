The problem with waiting till cifs_put_tcon (although it wouldn't hurt
to also call close_all_deferred_files() there or in cifs_kill_sb) is
that that is too late.

We don't get notified when umount begins except on force umount
("umount_begin") so a simple scenario like:

          echo "data in new file" >> /mnt2/newfile ; umount /mnt2

will wait until the deferred close timeout ("closetimeo") before
closing these files and then sending the tree disconnect, so in that
example tree discconnect was unnecessarily delayed (although "umount"
completes immediately, we can't send the tree disconnect until all the
closetimeouts expire since we will not receive the "kill_sb()" call
until the deferred close references are released).

Closing deferred files in various scenarios ("umount -f" and calls to
"shutdown") can help us send the tree disconnect faster and not tie up
resources on the server longer for files we won't be using
