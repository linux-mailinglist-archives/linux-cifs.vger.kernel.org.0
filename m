The original problem, i.e. compound operations like
unlink/rename/setsize not sending a lease key is very prevalent on the
field.
Unfortunately, fixing that exposed this problem with hard links.
So Steve suggested getting this fix to a shape where it's fixing the
original problem, even if it means that it does not fix it for the
case of where there are open handles to multiple hard links to the
same file.
Only thing we need to be careful of is that it does not make things
worse for other workloads.

This seems like a reasonable change to make. That will make sure that
we stick to what the protocol recommends.
I'm not sure that this change will be a simple one. There could be
several places where we make an assumption that the lease is
associated with an inode, and not a link.

And I'm not yet fully convinced that the spec itself is doing the
right thing by tying the lease with the link, rather than the file.
Shouldn't the lease protect the data of the file, and not the link
itself? If opening two links to the same file with two different lease
keys end up breaking each other's leases, what's the point?

Meetakshi is investigating this one.
Initial investigations led us to believe that this is related to
deferred closes. The failing tests do show that the close is getting
delayed, and that setting closetimeo=3D0 causes the test to pass.
However, it is not clear why the test started failing only now. We'll
have the answers soon.
