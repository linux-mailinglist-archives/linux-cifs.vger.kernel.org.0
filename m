I've figured out a workaround, but I'm unsure about it and I could really use some advice from people with more insight.


I said before that my servers (and yours too) have

# cat /etc/pam.d/sshd | grep keyinit
session    optional     pam_keyinit.so revoke force

And the problem shows up when I detach tmux, **log out**, log back in and reattach tmux; then I see


p115628@davis:~$ keyctl list @s
keyctl_read_alloc: Key has been revoked

The word 'revoked' was the obvious clue I: just to remove the 'revoke' option and the problem goes away:

# cat /etc/pam.d/sshd | grep keyinit
session    optional     pam_keyinit.so force


This keeps the session-keyring(7) working even after reattaching. Because it's the **log out** that is disabling the keyring; per pam_keyinit(8) [1]:

This change seems to have solved the immediate complaints from my users. But I don't like overriding the default like this; I assume there's a series of good reasons for using 'revoke' that I don't understand.

Would there be interest in switching to KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING? Would it be a good idea? Can I assume the kernel CIFS code would need a matching change?
