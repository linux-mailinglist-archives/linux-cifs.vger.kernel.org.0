Hi

Here is why xfstest 591 must be failing when the lease key is being
reused for the
unlink compound operation and closetimeo is set to any value other than 0
(deferred close is supported).

The splice_test program xfstest 591 uses calls unlink() at the end of the
program to delete the file A without closing the file handle first. This
file is thus marked for delete and the server returns STATUS_DELETE_PENDING=
.
If the mount options have specified anything other than closetimeo=3D0 i.e.=
 if
we have enabled deferred closes, the open handle to this file (which was no=
t
closed by the application), would have deferred closed once the application
ends. When the shell script runs the splice_test program again, the same
handle from the previous run of the splice_test program - that was supposed
to be closed because the file is deleted- is used by the next open to
open file A
since handle caching is still allowed for its lease.
This leads to the error: No such file or directory which we see in
the file 591.out.bad.
This error was not observed when unlink operation broke leases because when
the server issued a lease break to the client, it made the client flush its
remaining writes/locks to the server and downgrade its lease from RWH to R.
Since handle caching is not involved here anymore, the handle was also not
reused anymore by the next open.
Now that the patch has removed the lease break communication with the
server, something similar to what happens when a client gets lease break
notification might need to be done. One solution could be to flush all
cached writes to the server and downgrade all leases for open handles to
file A to R or 0 as soon as unlink is issued for the file A. In this case, =
even
if some file handles are deferred closed, they would not be reused.
A simple repro for this bug when the above patch 1/2 is applied (courtesy o=
f
@bharath):
1.  Mount share with closetimeo=3D30
2.  (shell1): tail -f /dev/null > myfile
3.  (shell2): rm myfile
4.  (shell1): ctrl+c to close myfile handle. This would be deferred closed
5.  Touch myfile will fail for a period  =3D closetimeo value

Thanks
Meetakshi
