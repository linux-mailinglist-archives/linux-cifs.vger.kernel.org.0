Yes - those are good points.  Because the latencies vary the most for
network/cluster filesystems which can vary by more than a million
times greater (from localhost and RDMA (aka smbdirect) which can be
very low latencies, to some cloud workloads which have longer
latencies by high throughput, or to servers where the files are
'offline' (archived or in the cloud) where I have seen some examples
where it could take minutes instead) - it is especially important for
this in the long run to be better tunable.  In the short term, at
least having some tuneables on the file system mount (like Ceph's
"rapages") makes sense.

Seems like there are three problems to solve:
- the things your note mentions about how to get the core readahead
code to ramp up a 'reasonable' number of I/Os are very important
but also
- how to let a filesystem signal the readahead code to slow down or
allow partially fulfilling read ahead requests (in the SMB3 case this
can be done when 'credits' on the connection (one 'credit' is needed
for each 64K of I/O) are starting to get lower)
- how to let a filesystem signal the readahead code to temporarily
stop readahead (or max readahead at one i/o of size = readsize).  This
could happen e.g. when the filesystem gets an "out of resources" error
message from the server, or when reconnect is triggered
