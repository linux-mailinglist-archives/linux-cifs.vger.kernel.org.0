Seems obviously enough correct.

Also obviously the cache needs to be kept in sync, but is it accurate to
set the allocation size before writing? That's the server's field, so
shouldn't it be written, then queried?

What actually goes on the wire diring the test? It looks like the
munmap step should be msync'ing - does cifs.ko not write the data?
