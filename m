Hi Enzo,
One "problem" with using just the version field is that it has a
predefined format.
This may not help us in decoding what distro and if it is a custom
kernel. utsname()->release gives all that.
So I'm planning to use workstation_name in the "hostname:release"
format. Let me know if you see some issues with it.
