            Bug ID: 15274
           Summary: detection for systemd in mount.cifs.c fails when
                    running in 'unified' systemd breaking ask password
                    functionatlity which leads to permission denied
           Product: CifsVFS
           Version: 5.x
          Hardware: All
                OS: Linux
            Status: NEW
          Severity: regression
          Priority: P5
         Component: user space tools
          Assignee: jlayton@samba.org
          Reporter: eric.vannier@gmail.com
        QA Contact: cifs-qa@samba.org
  Target Milestone: ---

The current code to detect whether to invoke systemd-ask-password does the
following logic:


        is_systemd_running =3D (lstat("/sys/fs/cgroup", &a) =3D=3D 0)
                && (lstat("/sys/fs/cgroup/systemd", &b) =3D=3D 0)
                && (a.st_dev !=3D b.st_dev);


Though as explained in https://systemd.io/CGROUP_DELEGATION/ the presence of
/sys/fs/cgroup/systemd is not guaranteed on systems running systemd: indeed=
, it
is only present in 'legacy' mode.

As such, this means that any system that would be running in 'hybrid' or
'unified', the code fails to detect that systemd is running and defaults to=
 the
'getpass' method.

This obviously breaks the usage of mount.cifs inside systemd units.

Ubuntu 20.04 seems to ship in legacy mode, and it is working correctly, whi=
le
Ubuntu 22.04 is shipping in unified mode, and it breaks. Further given the
above documentation, it seems likely that more distributions are likely to =
be
configured in unified mode, and it seems reasonable to think this might be
affecting a great deal of users that rely on the systemd-ask-password solut=
ion
(as is necessary when mounting from a systemd unit).

I am not sure what the portable and reliable way to detect systemd, but a f=
ew
options that come to mind:
- /proc/1/comm =3D=3D 'systemd' might provide that information (but I would=
 agree
this might not be super maintainable and might be a too linuxy ?).
- doing the statfs code mentioned inside https://systemd.io/CGROUP_DELEGATI=
ON/,
though this seems kind of fragile in my humble opinion: in the end, the
mount.cifs should not really care which mode it is running on (what the
documentation tries to explain), and should only want to find out if it is
running within systemd at all.
- then maybe, the lazy/simple approach is to simply rely on the success/fai=
lure
of launching systemd-ask-password ... After all, if it exists, and returned
successfully one can probably assume that this is all we want in the first
place ?

Additional repro steps:
- configure a unit for example as <mount_point>.mount
"""
[Unit]
Requires=3Dnetwork-online.target
After=3Dnetwork-online.service

[Mount]
What=3D<samba_share>
Where=3D<mount_point>
Type=3Dcifs
Options=3Dnosuid,nodev,iocharset=3Dutf8,username=3D<user>,uid=3D<user>,gid=
=3D<user>,mfsymlinks,file_mode=3D0740,dir_mode=3D0750,noauto

[Install]
"""
(Note that I am pretty sure the options do not matter for the repro case, b=
ut
are reproduced here since this is how I reproduced).

- run: systemctl start <mount_point>.mount
observe that systemd-ask-password is not invoked and instead getpass is
invoked, but since  the stdin is not connected to the tty, you can only see=
 the
information in the logs (journalctl -u <mount_point>.mount:
mount[31947]: Password for <user>@<samba_share>:
mount[31946]: mount error(13): Permission denied

(permission denied since I must assume it passed the empty password).

Thanks a lot for your consideration. I could propose a patch and test on Ub=
untu
20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04, but per above, I am not quite sure which implementa=
tion
you would prefer.
