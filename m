I think that was the idea yes, or maybe integrate with PAM somehow? But
you'll have to do some archeological work with Jeff Layton to get to the
bottom of this :)

This is a sadistic puzzle game with many pieces...

If the Linux client is properly integrated with AD ({winbind or ssd} +
PAM module + nsswitch conf), you login with your AD user and get an AD
uid. There is no local user.

I don't know what is the situation at Redhat but at SUSE the only
supported way to use multiuser mounts (if even documented) is via a
properly AD-joined system and kerberos. Even then, I think I've only
seen 1 ticket from a multiuser setup in 5 years. Most setups are 1 mount
per user for user dirs, where it makes sense to have everything owned by
the user.

At the SMB level you only see Windows SIDs and cifs.ko will report all
files as being owned by the mounter's uid (or uid=3D mount opt).

When you mount with cifsacl mount option, cifs.ko will try to map those
SIDs to uids by upcalling cifs.idmap. This program will ultimately query
winbind or sssd to get the mapping.

So userspace tools will see AD uids. Now to get the text username from
it they use regular POSIX libc calls like getpwuid(). If your system is
properly integrated with AD, this call gets rerouted via nsswitch to
again use winbind/sssd.

There is a book that covers some of this called "Mechanics of User
Identification and Authentication: Fundamentals of Identify
Management". It's from 2007 but still relevant. Here's a diagram from
page 96: https://i.imgur.com/PBwXIuJ.png

Nsswitch: allows to replace the various traditional text-based databases
of the system (/etc/passwd, /etc/hosts, ....) by calling into different
backends.
