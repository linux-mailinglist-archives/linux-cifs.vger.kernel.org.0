Ronnie,

I still think that your patch needs additional fix here:

-----------
/*
* If signal is pending but we have already sent the whole packet to
* the server we need to return success status to allow a corresponding
* mid entry to be kept in the pending requests queue thus allowing
* to handle responses from the server by the client.
*
* If only part of the packet has been sent there is no need to hide
* interrupt because the session will be reconnected anyway, so there
* won't be any response from the server to handle.
*/

if (signal_pending(current) && (total_len !=3D send_length)) {
cifs_dbg(FYI, "signal is pending after attempt to send\n");
rc =3D -EINTR;
        ^^^
        This should be changed to -ERESTARTSYS to allow kernel to
restart a syscall.

}
-----------

Since the signal may remain pending when we enter the sending loop, we
may end up not sending the whole packet before TCP buffers become
full. In this case according to the condition above the code returns
-EINTR but what we need here is to return -ERESTARTSYS instead to
allow system calls to be restarted.

Thoughts?
