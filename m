Hi Tom,

Thanks for the review.
Please read my comments below.

Agreed. I'm not proposing to change that.

Yeah. We only share primary channels today with other sessions.
I plan to change this in two stages. First, will enforce nosharesock
for multichannel.
I'll submit another patch later to reuse existing connections, unless
the user has explicitly used nosharesock as a mount option.

For users looking for performance, we could advise that they mount
with nosharesock, in addition to multichannel. That way, those
connections would be dedicated to only that session, and will not be
shared.
For others (maybe they're using multichannel for network tolerance),
we make use of connection pool.

I agree. But we do that today when sessions share a connection.

This is interesting. I should be able to do the RDMA filtering based
on whether the mount specified rdma as an option.
How do we know whether the server adapter can support bus or CPU
affinity? The only two capabilities that the server can advertise are
RSS_CAPABLE or RDMA_CAPABLE.

Fast as in advertised speed in the query interface response i.e. bandwidth.

I could modify my patch to take an interleaved weighted round robin,
so that each new connection is done to the next server interface.
This would ensure that the number of connections to each server
interface would be evenly shared.
