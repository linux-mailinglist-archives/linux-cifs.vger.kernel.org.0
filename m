This is related only to the Windows SMB server (or other servers which
implements only the Windows behavior; not POSIX).

My point is that the directory entry in the STATUS_DELETE_PENDING state
is not deleted. The directory entry when is in this state it still
exists. And Windows application (or Windows SMB client) can change this
STATUS_DELETE_PENDING state to the normal state at any time. Basically
it is like transaction. After changing directory entry into the
STATUS_DELETE_PENDING you need to either "confirm" this deletion or to
"cancel" it.

The Linux SMB client does not support this "cancel" functionality but
any other clients can support it and Windows one is example.

So in my opinion I think that on Windows the directory entry in the
STATUS_DELETE_PENDING is not removed and hence I think that reporting
"ENOENT" on Linux to userspace is not correct. The entry still exists.

On POSIX/Linux there is unlink syscall which completely removes the
directory entry. This is opposite of the STATUS_DELETE_PENDING which
just puts the directory entry into some temporary / pending state.
The unlink cannot be "cancelled".

I think that filtering out directory entries which are in
STATUS_DELETE_PENDING from the readdir() is not a good idea. Because in
this case the readdir() on directory which has only STATUS_DELETE_PENDING
children would return empty list of entries, but the rmmdir() would fail
on it with error ENOTEMPTY. This is because entries in
STATUS_DELETE_PENDING still exists in that directory and Windows really
does not allow to remove directory which contain child entries (and it
does not matter if the child entries are in normal state or in
STATUS_DELETE_PENDING state).

So I think it would be very confusing if Linux readdir() would report
that directory is empty but rmdir() will fail with ENOTEMPTY error.
I think that this would be less accurate with POSIX behavior.

My other patches in that series are improving SMB client to allow
calling "stat /mnt/deleted-but-still-open-file" and fill stat buffer
without EBUSY error. Just opening a file for reading or writing would
fail with EBUSY.

On Windows and also over SMB it is possible to do "stat" also for
directory entries which are in STATUS_DELETE_PENDING.

And important is that Windows C stat() function in msvcrt.dll and UCRT
libraries is already allowing it and working fine also with files in
STATUS_DELETE_PENDING.

Note that NFS3 (client) has similar problem. Its unlink syscall is
implemented as silly-rename, it just rename file and disallow opening
it. But the directory entry still exists, other users can call "stat" on
it, just cannot open it.

So I think that returning EBUSY, which implies that the filename still
exists is a correct thing to do. Because the file really still exists.
It was not removed / unlinked from the directory yet. And hence also the
directory cannot be removed yet because it contains child entries.

Note that this whole thing is only for Windows SMB behavior, not the
Samba or other POSIX implementation where the real unlink happens.
