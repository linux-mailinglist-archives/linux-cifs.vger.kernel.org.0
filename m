Thanks, Tom. (see below)

So I ran these tests several times to confirm what I was seeing. Again,
they might look (and actually are) micro-optimizations at first sight.
But the improvement comes from the fact that cifs.ko calls the affected
functions many, many times, even for such light (50MB copy) workloads.

On those tests of mine, the user-perceived (i.e. wall clock) improvement
was presented as a 0.02 - 0.05 seconds difference -- still looks minor
for, e.g. NAS boxes that does backups once a week, but aiming for 24/7
90% loaded datacenter systems, my expectation is this will be called an
improvement.


Cheers,

Enzo
