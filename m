Kia Ora Steve,

I'm working with Kevin on this, and I set up a clean environment with
the latest software to make sure this is all still an issue on current
software:

I was hoping to include the old SMB1 unix extensions in this test also,
but these seem unsupported in current kernels.  When did they go away?

Anyway, here is the data.  It certainly looks like an issue with the
SMB3 client, as only the client changes with the cache=none

Server is Samba 4.20.1 from Debian Sid.  Kernel is 
Linux debian-sid-cifs-client 6.7.9-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian
6.7.9-2 (2024-03-13) x86_64 GNU/Linux

With SMB1 but not unix extensions (seems unsupported):

root@debian-sid-cifs-client:~# mount.cifs //192.168.122.234/testuser
mnt -o user=testuser,pass=pass,vers=1.0
root@debian-sid-cifs-client:~# cd mnt/
root@debian-sid-cifs-client:~/mnt# ../lock_test foo 
Testing with foo
Got new file descriptor 3
Lock set: 1
Second file descriptor 4
Read from second fd: x count: 0
Third file descriptor 5
Wrote to third fd: 1

root@debian-sid-cifs-client:~# mount.cifs //192.168.122.234/testuser
mnt -o user=testuser,pass=penguin12#,vers=3.1.1,posix
root@debian-sid-cifs-client:~# cd mnt/
root@debian-sid-cifs-client:~/mnt# ../lock_test foo 
Testing with foo
Got new file descriptor 3
Lock set: 1
Second file descriptor 4
Read from second fd: x count: -1
Third file descriptor 5
Wrote to third fd: -1
root@debian-sid-cifs-client:~# mount.cifs //192.168.122.234/testuser
mnt -o user=testuser,pass=penguin12#,vers=3.1.1,unix

root@debian-sid-cifs-client:~# mount.cifs //192.168.122.234/testuser
mnt -o user=testuser,pass=penguin12#,vers=3.1.1,unix,nobrl
root@debian-sid-cifs-client:~# cd mnt/
root@debian-sid-cifs-client:~/mnt# ../lock_test foo 
Testing with foo
Got new file descriptor 3
Lock set: 1
Second file descriptor 4
Read from second fd: o count: 1
Third file descriptor 5
Wrote to third fd: 1

And with cache=none

root@debian-sid-cifs-client:~# mount.cifs //192.168.122.234/testuser
mnt -o user=testuser,pass=penguin12#,vers=3.1.1,posix,cache=none
root@debian-sid-cifs-client:~# cd mnt/
root@debian-sid-cifs-client:~/mnt# ../lock_test foo 
Testing with foo
Got new file descriptor 3
Lock set: 1
Second file descriptor 4
Read from second fd: o count: 1
Third file descriptor 5
Wrote to third fd: 1
