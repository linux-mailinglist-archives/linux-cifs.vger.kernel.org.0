No.  I *don't* want to see the previous state.  That's where the problem is:
The previous state isn't cleared up until the point I ask for a new batch -
but I need to query the ractl to find the remaining window before I can ask
for a new batch.

The first pass through the loop is, in effect, substantially different to the
second and subsequent passes.

Fuse has exactly the same issues:

		nr_pages = readahead_count(rac) - nr_pages;
		if (nr_pages > max_pages)
			nr_pages = max_pages;
		if (nr_pages == 0)
			break;
		ia = fuse_io_alloc(NULL, nr_pages);
		...
		nr_pages = __readahead_batch(rac, ap->pages, nr_pages);

It needs to find out how many pages it needs so that it can allocate its page
array before it can get a new batch, but the ractl is holding the previous
state.

> Can't you pull readahead_index() out of the ractl ahead of the mutation?

I'm not sure what you mean by that.  What I'm now doing is:

	while ((nr_pages = readahead_count(ractl) - ractl->_batch_count)) {
		...
		pgoff_t index = readahead_index(ractl) + ractl->_batch_count;
		...
		rc = cifs_fscache_query_occupancy(
			ractl->mapping->host, index, nr_pages,
		...
		rc = server->ops->wait_mtu_credits(server, cifs_sb->ctx->rsize,
						   &rsize, credits);
		...
		nr_pages = min_t(size_t, rsize / PAGE_SIZE, readahead_count(ractl));
		nr_pages = min_t(size_t, nr_pages, next_cached - index);
		...
		rdata = cifs_readdata_alloc(nr_pages, cifs_readv_complete);
		...
		got = __readahead_batch(ractl, rdata->pages, nr_pages);
		...
	}

I need the count to know how many, if any, pages are remaining; I need the
count and index of the window to find out if fscache has any data; I need the
count to allocate a page array.  Only after all that can I crank the next
batch for the server (assuming I didn't delegate to the cache along the way,
but that calls readahead_page()).

(Yes, I would like to remove this code entirely and just call into netfslib.
I have patches to do that, but it involves quite an overhaul of the cifs
driver, but the above might get cifs caching again more quickly pending that.
Maybe I should just take the easy way here and cache the last state so that I
can compensate in the way fuse does).
