Dear Friend,


There is something very important I need to discuss with you.  I 
am writing  this letter in tears and fear. In tears because I 
will soon depart and in fear because I don't really know if you 
will do this faithfully.

I am COVID-19  patient and the doctor has already confirmed I may 
not last for the next 7 days.

I have substantial amount of money deposited in a security vault 
around your country. It is in trunk boxes and once  I receive 
your response and see your readiness to claim the money 
immediately, I will forward the needed documents and the contact 
of the security vault where the consignment is deposited,
I am not asking you to give me anything but I want you to help 
people that has been infected with this deadly virus with 60% of 
the money and 40% should be for you and your family.

I will disclose exact amount in the boxes as soon as I 
receive your response.


Regards.
