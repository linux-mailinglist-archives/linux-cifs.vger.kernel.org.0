Dear Steve,

Thank you so much for the long list of recommendations and tips.
I will try to answer to some of your questions that I can answer right
away, and will try to
come back to you on the others at a later time.

Yes, it is in deed. A directory typically has between 1700 and 1100
files, with a total size of
about 150 GB. In each directory there is one large file with a size of
between 90 and 100 GB,
and the rest of the 1xxx files are about 40-50 MB each.
Based on the recommendations I got over the samba mailing-list, I
recommended some config
changes that would hopefully reduce the number of the smaller files in
a directory to about 1/8th
of the current numbers. We'll see what difference that change makes.
Ideally one or two such directories are copied in a routine rsync job run.

Thank you, we will try this option!
In our case, the machine offering the share is doing so for only one client=
.
There is another client, but that uses a different/non-overlapping share.

As mentioned, our appliance is Ubuntu-based, but unfortunately it's
built on 18.04 LTS.
Currently we use a 4.15 version kernel, so can be considered old by now.

During our tests, we tried using CIFS version 3.1.1, but the mount did
not succeed.
In our tests CIFS version 3.02 was the latest one the mount succeeded with.
It may be that CIFS 3.1.1 support was missing from either the 4.15
Linux kernel, or
it may have not been present in the Windows 2012 Storage Edition, that
was providing the share.

Okay, we'll make sure to try that one too.

I guess we use the default caching, but I'll look into it.

 helps.

Unfortunately doing that is not so easy in our case, but we may give
it some thought
to see whether and how it could be done.

Okay, the next time we do some testing, I will monitor that counter as well=
.

Thank you so much Steve for your help!
