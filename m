Hi Adam,

Sorry it took me a while to look at this. The patch itself looks good
to me. Could you please add an appropriate description, create a patch
with "git format-patch" command and re-send it to the list? This would
allow me to merge it quickly. Submitting a PR on github against the
"next" branch is another good option.
