This is what I meant.
+               if ((u64)work->next_smb2_rcv_hdr_off +
le32_to_cpu(hdr->NextCommand) + 64 >

It could just be an early check that what hdr->NextCommand points to
has at least 64 bytes.
I.e. an early test that "does the next PDU have at least a full smb2 header=
?"

I mean, since you already test that NextCommand is valid,  you could
at the same time also
test that the next pdu is at least 64 bytes.
