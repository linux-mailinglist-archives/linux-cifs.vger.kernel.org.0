I can modify that if statement, no problem. I just did not wanted to
touch POSIX code path as my focus is on the Windows code path.
I do not know all those case which POSIX paths against POSIX server may
trigger, so it was safer for me to let POSIX as is.

Both "set delete pending" and "rename" operations are working (if open
pass). Just "set delete pending" does not unlink file/dir immediately
but rather wait until path is not busy anymore. "rename" on the other
hand is executed immediately.

So we can rename the in-use/busy file on Windows server, but we cannot
remove it immediately. We can only "schedule" its removal on the Windows
server. So combination of "rename" + "schedule removal" is what are
patches doing.

In case open fails (e.g. due to conflicting DENY shared reservations or
because path is already in delete pending state) then obviously it is
not possible to continue with either rename or set delete pending
operation, both then fails.

I do not have them right now, but I can run test scenario and capture
them, this is not problem. Test case is pretty straightforward.
