Sorry, I might have not been clear.  By "variable data" I actually meant
data that's not going to be allocated in the requests' iovs, but rather
in rqst->rq_pages.

The variable buffers that are already expected (by PDU/spec), are AFAICS
always allocated either through cifs*buf_get() or some kmalloc() variant,
i.e. non-HIGHMEM.

async IO, though, is the only place I can see that allocates
rqst->rq_pages through iov_iter_get_pages_alloc2(), which is the source
of my concern, and the reason of my patch.  Particularly, on async read
cases, the page data is pre-allocated with the size we *expect* to
receive/read from the server, but if there's an error in a READ
response, the response itself will contain no/incomplete data in the page
data, but since those pages are allocated, the signature computation will
account for it, and generate a mismatching signature.

I'm running more tests now and I'll make sure to test the other possible
errors in 2.2.2.2.

For the good messages ok, of course, but for bad? Why not? Otherwise, e.g.,
spotting the misvalidation mentioned above would've taken much longer.

(btw I spotted that misvalidation while debugging my AES-GMAC series,
but the same behaviuour happens with AES-CMAC i.e. in current code)

Ack :)
