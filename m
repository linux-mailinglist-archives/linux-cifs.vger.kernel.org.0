From my readings so far, -ERESTARTSYS assumes that the syscall is idempoten=
t.
Can we safely make such assumptions for all VFS file operations? For
example, what happens if a close gets restarted, and we already
scheduled a delayed close because the original close failed with
ERESTARTSYS?

Also, I ran a quick grep for EINTR, and it looks like __cifs_readv and
__cifs_writev return EINTR too. Should those be replaced by
ERESTARTSYS too?

Regards,
Shyam

Shyam
