I did some code reading on samba-winbind (and sssd to some extent),
and here are a few things I noticed.
1. Both today have almost "no-op" handlers for open and close of PAM sessio=
ns.
2. However, the login and logoff do have some functionalities. PAM
setcred is done both on log-on and log-off, so that the cred cache is
deleted on the last logoff.
3. Login and logoff have ref counts associated with a user. But I do
notice that a kinit is done on every login (even if the user is
already logged on).

So it looks like (at least as of today) we don't break much by
authenticating with PAM. One additional change needed would be to
introduce umount.cifs, which deletes PAM credentials for the user.

Alternatively, another option is to not rely on winbind/sssd for
authentication (or maintaining krb5 tgt up-to-date), but instead let
cifs-utils deal with it separately. Today, cifs.upcall has a way to
kinit if the cred cache file is missing. But that needs the keytab
file to be populated with the key for the user in question. We could
also try a kinit based on password in mount.cifs (if the cred cache is
missing), and if that works, populate the keytab file with the key for
this user (for cifs.upcall to use later, when necessary).

Thoughts?

Regards,
Shyam
