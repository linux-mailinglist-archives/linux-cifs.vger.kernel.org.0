Except SMB spec, why do you need to provide "RDMA-capable" information?
Is it must? What will it give to the users? Why can't you treat IPoIB
like any other netdevice?

Let's start with an answer to more simple question: "why do you need
this capability flag?"

Yes, ib_device_get_by_netdev and get_netdev are intended to perform
lookup of ib device based on underlying netdev, but in IPoIB case you
are interested in ib device based on upper netdev.

So this leads to another question, if user didn't ask to connect SMB to
IB device and chose netdevice (IPoIB) instead, why are you still forcing
him to take IB path? If it is not user's decision and you are choosing
devices from the list, you already have in your list the IB device which
is connected to IPoIB.

Thanks
