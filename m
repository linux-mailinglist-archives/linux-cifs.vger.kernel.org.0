We could. But that is a windowism where ':' is a reserved character
but which is not a reserved character in unixens.
For example:
You have the file "foo" with stream "bar" and you have another normal
file "foo:bar"
Which one does open("foo:bar") give you?

The openat/... semantics that solaris uses provides an elegant and
unambiguous semantics for it.
You want to open stream bar on file foo?
1, fh =3D open("foo")
2, sh =3D openatf(h, "bar")

There are at least two non-windows related filesystems that support
something similar to ADS,
solaris filesystem and apples filesystem(s) so it would be nice to
have a neutral API where an application can use the same
code to access streams be they cifs/ntfs/solarisfs/applefs/...other...

Steve, I think this would be a good discussion topic for vfs meetings.
Is it desirable to bless an api in the vfs to do alternate data
streams?
There are at least 4 filesystems that provide this feature, 3 of which
are still very popular and common today.

One approach would be to mimic the interface that solaris provides
with openatfile-fd, "stream-name")
But that would not just be a filesystem change but also a VFS change
since it would suddenly accept passing a file-fd as argument
as a valid option (for those filesystems that have signalled
alternative stream support?)
while the vfs currently only allows openat() on a directory-fd.

ADS as a concept is really powerful and could be enormously useful as
way to attach metadata to a file object in a standardized way.
There are very many use-cases where having a file that embedded both
the executable as well as various other types of data but still be
able to treat it as a single self-contained file from an end-user
perspective.

This should be discussed and we should probe the vfs folks about what
they think about it.
