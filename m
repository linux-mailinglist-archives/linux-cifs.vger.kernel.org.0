Thanks for your (possible) confirmation.

I wasn't aware of Ubuntu's "LTS enablement stack" (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack).
A simple 'sudo apt install --install-recommends linux-generic-hwe-20.04' brings the latest LTS to Kernel 5.11.0-27 and cifs.ko to 2.30.

Strange enough (but gratefully so) this did solve my problem - the lockups don't manifest anymore.
I wouldn't have expected this, since your patches from June 4 brought cifs.ko to 2.31. Must be some earlier change then?

Anyway, our problem is gone. Thanks again.

Best regards
Thomas
