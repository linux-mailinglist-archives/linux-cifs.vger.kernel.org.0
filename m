Hi Michael,

What happens when credentials are not supplied in keytab files? Is
there a way to supply the credentials from other sources in that case?
The reason why I'm asking this is that this same code can be used by
cifscreds (or a new executable) to perform the authentication, and
collect the krb5 tickets.

Also, in the cifs.upcall changes, you could check for the
GSS_USE_PROXY env variable. In the absence of which, fallback to the
older code. If that is done, it gives the user an option to go for one
option or the other.
Other than that, the changes look fine to me.

Regards,
Shyam
