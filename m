I think I understand what's going on here, and why Enzo's patch works
to prevent it.
I think what's going on is that cifs_extend_writeback can pick up a
folio on an extending write which has been dirtied, but we have a
clamp on the writeback to an i_size local variable, which can cause
short writes, yet mark the page as clean.

As an example, consider this scenario:
1. First write to the file happens offset 0 len 5k.
2. Writeback starts for the range (0-5k).
3. Writeback locks page 1 in cifs_writepages_begin. But does not lock
page 2 yet.
4. Page 2 is now written to by the next write, which extends the file
by another 5k. Page 2 and 3 are now marked dirty.
5. Now we reach cifs_extend_writeback, where we extend to include the
next folio (even if it should be partially written). We will mark page
2 for writeback.
6. But after exiting cifs_extend_writeback, we will clamp the
writeback to i_size, which was 5k when it started. So we write only 1k
bytes in page 2.
7. We still will now mark page 2 as flushed and mark it clean. So
remaining contents of page 2 will not be written to the server (hence
the hole in that gap, unless that range gets overwritten).

With the proposed patch, it skips the partially written folio in
cifs_extend_writeback, which should take care of the issue.

@David Howells / @Enzo Matsumiya / @Steve French : The above is just a
theory. I need to prove it. Please review.
I'm working on a revised patch (doing the boundary checking like
Enzo's change did, but addressing David's review comments). Depending
on how the testing goes, I think we should be able to submit the patch
tomorrow.
