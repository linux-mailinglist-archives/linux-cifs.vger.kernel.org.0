Yes, as the handle is closed immediately when oplock/lease breaks,
will there be any
silent side effects still?

As the handles are persistent once the session gets reconnected,
applications can reclaim
the handle. So, i believe no need to close handles immediately until
timeout(i.e acregmax interval)
