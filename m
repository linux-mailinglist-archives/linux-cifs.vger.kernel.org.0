Current version of the patch in for-next has the threshold at 3 not 1
for the maximum
oplock/lease credits - presumably that is low enough, and current
behavior won't change much
but we avoid the credit starvation.

I am not aware of any cases (or reported bugs) where echo credits
would go higher.
echo is just to periodically check if server is unresponsive/hung and
to reduce chance of reconnect issues.
It is rarely sent (every 60 seconds on inactive connections, and echo
interval can be set higher on mount if you prefer)
