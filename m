We are making progress.
Can you test this patch if it improves even more for you?
It fixes most but not all the leaks I see for interrupted open():

I will post this to the list too as a separate mail/patch.

    cifs: fix race between compound_send_recv() and the demultiplex thread
   =20
    There is a race where the open() may be interrupted between when we rec=
eive the reply
    but before we have invoked the callback in which case we never end up c=
alling
    handle_cancelled_mid() and thus leak an open handle on the server.
