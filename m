Aha - ok, got it. And I've been looking into those codepaths too because
the RDMA code fails badly when I try to optimize the completion path.
Right now, the code waits for ALL smbdirect packets to be sent before
returning, which is ridiculously inefficient. It does this in both
client and server sending. But if I remove the wait, nothing works as
it appears the queued buffers are either freed, or unwound from the
stack. Completely and totally bogus.

It's basic MITM. If there is such an attacker, it can trivially redirect
the client, by injecting an error undetected. Inspecting the payload
before doing the integrity check is just insecurely wrong.

Regarding the logging on signature validation, consider that an attacker
will therefore trivially be able to overrun the log, either DOSing the
system, or at the very least hiding other messages. Why alarm the
sysadmin, for something they are not likely to be able to act upon?
Bump a statistic, maybe.

To me, the kernel log is not informational, it's for critical actions.
For example, it requires root to even see it. Consider what you need to
tell such a person each time it happens. "Oops, I dropped a packet"
doesn't cut it. If it's a developer hint, then place it under CIFS FYI,
or some sort of opt-in diagnostic tracing channel.
