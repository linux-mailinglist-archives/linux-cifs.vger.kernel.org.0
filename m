After a quick look, we do not use ENOTSUPP a lot.
But there are three places in transport.c that look suspicious.
They all trigger if we run out of credits for an extended period and
from a brief glance it might be able to leak ENOTSUPP to userspace for
almost any syscall.

I think this needs to be audited. The places are
wait_for_compound_request() and wait_for_free_request().

What to do here is not obvious. We could retry in cifs.ko but we can't
do this indefinitely since when we have no credits
for an extended time, every syscall will become a new thread that gets
stuck in cifs.ko waiting for credits that might never become
available.
So maybe we should rework this and return -EAGAIN here, push it to
userspace right away and hope userspace can deal with it?

And if we decide to push -EAGAIN to userspace we might do that right
away without any retries in cifs.ko since if we have been at zero
credits for a long long time already chances are that retry will not
work and we will remain at zero credits for a long time more.
