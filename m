My preference is to have same IPoIB treatment for all ULPs, including SMB.

My GUESS is that SMB specification authors didn't take into account HW and
Linux SW development around IPoIB and weren't aware of IPoIB offload which
is implemented and enabled by default in all modern IB NICs and Linux OSes.

That offload allows line-rate for IPoIB, something that is not possible
for SW IPoIB.
