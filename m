Hello,

With nobrl no failure shows whatever the cache policy (so my lock_test give=
s=20
always the output of the example with cache=3Dnone below).

By current you mean 4.20.1?

So far I tested with 4.19.6 but couldn't get it to work. I get the followin=
g=20
in dmesg:
CIFS: VFS: Server does not support mounting with posix SMB3.11 extensions

Despite having the following in my smb.conf:
server max protocol =3D SMB3_11
smb3 unix extensions =3D yes

Am I using something too old? I honestly don't know when the extensions wer=
e=20
added.

Regards.
