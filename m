Hi Steve,

During response handling, in case oplock_credits reach 0, we anyhow
have it stealing one credit from regular credits today...
        else if (server->in_flight > 0 && server->oplock_credits =3D=3D 0 &=
&
                 server->oplocks) {
                if (server->credits > 1) {
                        server->credits--;
                        server->oplock_credits++;
                }
        }

So I don't think we need to reserve more than 1 credits for
oplock_credits at all.
I think the behaviour would not be affected by restricting oplock_credits t=
o 1.
