As Rohith has been investigating, there can be cases where
   "CIFS VFS: No task to wake, unknown frame received!"
is ok (e.g. races between close and oplock break) but to investigate
your storage problem some additional information could be helpful.

Is this a large file workload, or lots of small files in directories,
or deep directory trees?

Large directories, and deep directory trees can result in the Linux
VFS layer doing many revalidate
requests beyond the default 1 second metadata caching timeout (cifs.ko
is stricter than some other
fs in defaulting to 1 second).   Especially if this is the only client
likely to update the files while backing them up
then setting actimeo much higher (e.g. actimeo=3D30) could be helpful.

In general SMB3.1.1 is MUCH faster with reasonably current Ubuntu
(make sure you have updated
your Ubuntu to at least 5.4 although current Ubuntu AFAIK is 5.8 or
5.11 kernel now).   It is VERY
important to use a kernel more recent than 5.3, not just because of
the many bugfixes but also
because of the addition of GCM (much faster) encryption for SMB3.1.1
in 5.3 kernel.kernel:

There are very few cases where you want to mount with something other
than the default (which
for modern servers is almost always SMB3.1.1, e.g. default or
explicitly with "vers=3D3.1.1") as GCM
encryption is faster.  There are a few cases where SMB1 POSIX
Extensions can be helpful but there
are tradeoffs with older SMB1 being so much less secure and so many
other features missing from the
20+ year old SMB1 - use the default SMB3.1.1 if possible.

There are other parameters that can be helpful e.g. "nostrictsync" in
some cases.

Also consider whether rsync is what you want to use - rsync picks an
unfortunately small default I/O size and its
maximum I/O size is also terrible - this is less of an issue if you
are using the default caching (which goes
through the Linux page cache so will aggregate I/O into larger chunks)
but for a network FS you really want
I/O 1MB or larger (SMB2+ will typically default to 4MB or 1MB I/O and
even NFSv4+ will typically default to 1MB)

If you have the ability to try newer kernels (e.g. Ubuntu makes it
very easy to download install packages to update
to the more current 5.13 kernel from the Ubuntu website for testing on
older Ubuntu) - give 5.13 a try and experiment
with the new mount parm ("rasize") e.g. setting it to 8MB and see if that h=
elps.

Another key thing to look at is whether there are reconnects being
triggered (e.g. by bad app behavior - like we saw
with scp sometimes sending signals accidentally killing the TCP
network connection, or by timeouts on the server,
or bugs that have been fixed in more recent kernels).   See the number
of reconnects in /proc/fs/cifs/Stats and if
it is increasing then focusing on whether that is a server bug, or a
bug due to an older kernel on the client which
is missing fixes can be useful.
