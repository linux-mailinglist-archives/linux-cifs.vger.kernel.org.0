That's correct.

The client will try to reuse the same server interface if it has the RSS
capability flag set.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-smb2/fcd862d1-1b85-42df-92b1-e103199f531f

RSS flag means that this server interface can handle things in parallel
efficiently.

Maybe the problem is not the number of CPU but the virtual network bus
bandwidth.

Let me explain: forget SMB and measure network speed (with iperf)
between 2 VMs. Let's say you get 1GB/s.

Now you add a virtual interface to the server VM and measure again on the 2
interfaces *at the same time*. You will see at most 500MB/s on each.

If you want to measure speedup, you need to limit the bandwidth of the
server interfaces with tc so that when you max out the server interface
bandwidth, you don't also max out the total virtual bus bandwidth.
If you limit 1MB/s on each, 1+1 = 2MB/s which is still << 1GB/s but you
will get speedup of 2.

No problem :)
