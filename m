I ran 5.4-rc4 plus this patch with the reproducer, and it ran fine for
over 6 hours.
I verified 5.4-rc4 would still crash too - at first I wasn't sure
since it took about 30 mins to crash, but it definitely crashes too
(not surprising).

Your patch seems reasonable to me and is in the spirit of the existing
code and the flag idea that Ronnie had.

To be honest when I look at the other flag (unrelated to this problem)
I am also not sure if it should be a state or a flag, but you probably
know the history on mid_state vs flag better than me.  For purposes of
this bug, I think your patch is fine and if you're wanting a stable
patch and this looks better, FWIW this is fine with me.  I think
probably as your comments earlier there is probably more refactoring
or work that can be done in this area, but is beyond the scope of a
stable patch.

Thanks!
