I agree that the error code may not be ideal. Shyam has a WIPto
replace it with EBUSY but EDEADLK may be a good alternative too. For
this patch I would prefer not to change the error code and only fix
the bug to allow less ricky backporting.

Yes. If the server is tight on resources or just gives us less credits
for other reasons (e.g. requests are coming out of order and the
server delays granting more credits until it receives a missing mid)
and we exhausted most available credits there may be situations when
we try to send a compound request but we don't have enough credits. At
this point the client needs to decide if it should wait for credits or
fail a request. If at least one request is in flight there is a high
probability that the server returns enough credits to satisfy the
compound request (which are usually 3-4 credits long). So, we don't
want to fail the request in this case.
