Subject: Re: mount.cifs fails to negotiate AES-256-GCM but works when enforced
 via sysfs or modprobe options

Re-sending as plain-text -- apologies, as my phone seems to only want
to send emails as HTML, so it never made it to the list.

Hi Shyam, thank you for bringing this up. I've seen this link and this
is for Kubernetes, so I've raised a case with Microsoft to improve the
documentation elsewhere to make it more clear, and also mentioned the
testing Enzo did indicated that with AES-128-GCM disabled, the share
is still providing it in the cipher list, which isn't documented
behavior.

I also found this Stack exchange post where someone with a TrueNAS
device encountered the same issue:
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/766995/linux-smb-client-failed-to-=
connect-to-smb-server-forcing-aes-256/800613#800613

When I first found that, before I posted here, I suggested that user
should try enforcing it on the client as this document suggests.

That being said, this seems to only be a requirement for mounting the
share in a Linux VM but based on Enzo's comments, mounting the exact
same share in a Windows VM has no such requirement to enforce
AES-256-GCM on the client side.

N.B. configure 2 storage accounts: one with AES-128 only, and one with
AES-256 only. Attempt to mount both at the same time to different
paths in a Linux VM. One will always be rejected depending on the
client's settings. Then attempt to mount both at the same time to
different drive letters in a Windows VM, and they both mount
successfully.


Thank you,

Thomas
