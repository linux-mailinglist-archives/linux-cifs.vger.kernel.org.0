Where ? Yes, they're in NTFS/SMB1-2-3/HFS because they have to be
for compatibility with other systems.

I don't see any Linux native filesystem that has these
things.

Please do not add them.

As is the question of whether this should be done at all.

GNOME works perfectly well without alternate data streams.

I don't see adding them would be a quality of life improvement,
and an extra morass of complexity for developers.

ADS is the motherlode of bad ideas for filesystems.
