Thanks for the reviews.

While rebasing older changes, I missed a single line during the
channel add code, which had caused a regression.
Fixed it and merged with the correct patch here:
https://github.com/sprasad-microsoft/smb-kernel-client/pull/5

I've also integrated Aurelien's comments into these patches.
Also, I've a couple of minor patches here to fix fscache warnings for
multichannel and to integrate new changes into DebugData.
@Steve French Please use these new patches.

@Paulo Alcantara That would be great if you can help testing my
changes. Please test with these new changes.

I'm wondering what would happen if there are multiple tcons to the
same origin_fullpath (possibly in different sessions)?
Also, doesn't failover targets apply to each channel under a session?
Shouldn't we switch targets on reconnect of secondary channels too?
