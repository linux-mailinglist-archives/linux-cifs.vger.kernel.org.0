That is correct, I think. Note that using when login in the system PAM
also sets up KRB5CCNAME variable that points to the credential cache
(e.g. "FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_0") and is then inherited in all processes in
the session.

Shouldn't we do it the other way around? i.e. try to use any existing
credential cache, and if that fails auth again with PAM. I think we
might end up overwriting an existing cache or logging in twice
otherwise.

I am not 100% sure about this but I think the session should be opened
in the context of the parent shell process to be able to be persistent,
otherwise the session will close when mount.cifs exits. Maybe there is a
way to pin the session on a different processes... But most likely there
is an existing session opened by PAM when the user initially logged in
the system (regardless of the PAM backend/params).
