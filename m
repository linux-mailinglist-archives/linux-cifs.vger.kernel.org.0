Thinking about this conditional assignment of the mid retry state: I don't think there is any case in the current code base where the WARN_ON you proposed would fire but I can't be sure about all possible stable kernel that the stable patch is going to be applied.

Right but look at it this way.  If we conditionally set the state,
then what is preventing a duplicate list_del_init call?  Let's say we
get into the special case that you're not sure it could happen
(mid_entry->mid_state == MID_REQUEST_SUBMITTED is false), and so the
mid_state does not get set to MID_RETRY_NEEDED inside cifs_reconnect
but yet the mid gets added to retry_list.  In that case both the
cifs_reconnect code path will call list_del_init as well as the other
code paths which we're adding the conditional tests and that will
cause a blowup again because cifs_reconnect retry_list loop will end
up in a singleton list and exhaust the refcount, leading to the same
crash.  This is exactly why the refcount only patch crashed again -
it's erroneous to think it's ok to modify mid_entry->qhead without a)
taking globalMid_Lock and b) checking mid_state is what you think it
should be.  But if you're really concerned about that 'if' condition
and want to leave it, and you want a stable patch, then the extra flag
seems like the way to go.  But that has the downside that it's only
being done for stable, so a later patch will likely remove it
(presumably).  I am not sure what such policy is or if that is even
acceptable or allowed.

> Another more general thought: we have cifs_delete_mid -> DeleteMidQEntry -> _cifs_mid_q_entry_release chain of calls and every function frees its own part of the mid entry. I think we should merge the last two at least. It would allow us to guarantee that holding a reference to the mid means:

I think this would allow to avoid all the problems discussed in this thread but looks too risky for stable.
