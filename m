Hello, I have redone these tests again. And the results are that
Windows SMB3.1.1 server really filter out this class 64 and does not
allow to use it.

But Windows SMB1 server does not filter this class 64 when sent over
SMB PASSTHROUGH (sent as level 0x03e8+64, see [MS-SMB] 2.2.2.3.5), and
normally execute it.

I have checked that over first SMB connection I opened the file, then
over second SMB connection I sent that UNLINK command and check that
over second SMB connection the file is not available in the directory
listing anymore, and at the same time over first SMB connection it was
possible to use file handle (of that opened file) for other operations.

So it looks like that at least SMB1 can benefit of this POSIX UNLINK
support. I have also checked that if I used first connection over
SMB3.1.1 then it still worked correctly (opened file handle was usable
and the file was not in directory listing anymore).

Do you know if SMB3.1.1 has something like [MS-SMB] 2.2.2.3.5
Pass-through Information Level Codes? If yes then it could be
implemented also for SMB3.1.1.
