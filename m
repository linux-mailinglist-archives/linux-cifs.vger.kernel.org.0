Hi Steve, thanks for looking into this.

The file server(s) I tried are members of a domain. One is a plain file 
server only, and the other is a domain controller, both are updated 
Windows Server 2012 installs. My linux system is not a member of the 
domain, and is an updated Gentoo install:

# cat /proc/fs/cifs/DebugData | grep Version
CIFS Version 2.20

# cat /proc/version
Linux version 5.2.2 (root@varws03) (gcc version 8.3.0 (Gentoo 8.3.0-r1 
p1.1)) #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Jul 25 09:08:17 MDT 2019

The actual command I am using right now to mount the share only works 
with the pre-windows 2000 logon name (18 characters):

# mount -v -t cifs -o 
username=xx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx,password=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,domain=xxxxxxxx-xxx,vers=3.0 
'//192.168.100.10/Test Share' /mnt/temp0

If I use the regular logon name (23 characters) I get these errors:

# mount -v -t cifs -o 
username=xx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxyyyyy,password=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,domain=xxxxxxxx-xxx,vers=3.0 
'//192.168.100.10/Test Share' /mnt/temp0
mount.cifs kernel mount options: 
ip=192.168.100.10,unc=\\192.168.100.10\Test 
Share,vers=3.0,user=xx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxyyyyy,domain=xxxxxxxx-xxx,pass=********
mount error(13): Permission denied
Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)

/var/log/messeges
Aug  1 08:43:06 testclient01 kernel: CIFS: Attempting to mount 
//192.168.100.10/Test Share

Aug  1 08:43:07 testclient01 kernel: CIFS VFS: cifs_mount failed 
w/return code = -13

Is the domain considered part of the 32 character username character 
limit? My domain is 12 characters, full logon name with the domain would 
be 35 characters (including the \ separator), while the pre-windows 2000 
name would be 31 characters with the \ separator.
