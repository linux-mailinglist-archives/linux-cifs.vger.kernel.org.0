In my opinion, sending the entire patchset to the relevant lists
should be the default for all the reasons mentioned above.  All the
other methods are fine, and I don't want to stop anyone from using
their favorite tool, but *requiring* the use of a separate tool to
properly review and comment on patches gets us away from the
email-is-universal argument.  Yes, all the other tools mentioned are
still based in a world of email, but if you are not emailing the
relevant stakeholders directly (or indirectly via a list), you are
placing another hurdle in front of the reviewers by requiring them to
leave their email client based workflow and jump over to lore, b4,
etc. to review the patchset.

The lore.kernel.org instance is wonderful, full stop, and the b4 tool
is equally wonderful, full stop, but they are tools intended to assist
and optimize; they should not replace the practice of sending patches,
with the full context, to the relevant parties.
