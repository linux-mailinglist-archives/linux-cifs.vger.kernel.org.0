That is something we can improve as aesthetics. Yes, we should try to
use already open directory handles if ones are available.
Right now this is probably low priority as we only cache the root directory.
When we expand this to other directories as well,   maybe cashe with a
lease the last n directories? and not just ""
we can do this and likely see improvements.

I don't think we can avoid this. The directory lease AFAIK only
triggers and breaks on when the directory itself is modified,
i.e. dirents are added/deleted/renamed   but not is pre-existing
direntries have changes to their inodes.

I.e. does a directory lease break just because an existing file in it
was extended? Does the lease break if an immediate subdirectory have
files added/removed, i.e. st_nlink changes, not for the directory we
have a lease on but a subdirectory where we do not  have a lease?
