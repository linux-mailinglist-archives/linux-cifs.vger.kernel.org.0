The SMB3 specification is completely unconcerned with IPoIB and any
other layer-2 or layer-3 implementation details. It merely discusses
an exchange of network interface capabilities such as link speed and
RDMA support. The SMB3 client uses this list to implement multichannel.

I totally agree that inspecting ARPHRD_INFINIBAND is an incorrect method
of building this list. Just because an interface supports IPoIB does not
mean it also exposes RDMA, especially in-kernel. And that ignores any
non-IB transport too of course.

Kangjing, please educate me if I'm confused here, but doesn't the
code in ksmbd_rdma_capable_netdev() look up the ib_device anyway, at
the end of the function?

So, why is the code concerned at all with ARPHRD_INFINIBAND just a few
lines above? And why does it look in the smb_direct_device_list first?
