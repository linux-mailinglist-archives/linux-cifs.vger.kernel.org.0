That's my fault then, sorry about that. At the time I submitted the
patch, there was no occurrence of module having multiple softdeps, so I
didn't know how it should be done. It was some time ago and I don't
remember the details though, and I have no trace of why I worked on
this in the first place.

Apparently I'm not the only one confused as I see driver
pcengines-apuv2 has exactly the same problem. I'll send a patch for
that one.

If multiple softdep statements are not supported then shouldn't we
prevent them from happening, either with a link-time check, or with a
checkpatch test? I have no idea how to implement such a check though.

That's my definition of a regular (not soft) dependency. If failing
soft pre dependencies are fatal, how do they differ from regular
dependencies? Only because they are listed explicitly instead of being
determined from symbol use?

FWIW modprobe.d(5) mentions "optional modules" and insists that the
main module is still usable without them, so my understanding was that
a modprobe would be attempted on soft deps but a failure would be
ignored.

The commit message may sound wrong to you but the (fixed version of the
patch) still solves the problem (including all potentially needed
modules in initrd even when there are no hard dependencies) at least as
a side effect. If you think that softdeps are not how the problem
should be solved, then how do you think it should be solved? I
understand that pre-loading all cipher and hash modules is not
efficient, but we still need to ensure that they all make it to the
initrd in case they are needed.

Or we could decide that cifs in initrd is not supported? To be honest
I'm not sure why people would do that. Samba mounts do not seem
appropriate for system or home partitions anyway... So maybe I tried to
solve a problem which nobody had in the first place. Can the CIFS
people please share their views on that? That's also a question for
Harald: Harald, what were you doing with the cifs driver which led you
to discovering this bug?

Patch looks sane, thanks.

Are you going to submit it or should I?

Alternatively the initial patch could be reverted, depending on the
answer to my question above.
