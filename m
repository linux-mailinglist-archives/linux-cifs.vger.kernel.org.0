This is interesting. I would assume that leases are a mechanism that
assure client that it is free to cache the file locally, and that the
server would inform the client when that is not safe anymore.
Hard links are in-fact pointing to the same file. So I would've
assumed that the server would have treated both links to have the same
lease.
So either the server should share leases between hard links.
If not, at least an existing RWH lease on link1 would be broken by RWH
lease requested by another client on link2. At least for the Windows
file server, that does not happen either.
Isn't this a bug from the correctness stand point?
