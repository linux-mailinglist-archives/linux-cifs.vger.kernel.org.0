Hi Steve,

GSSAPI and krb5 as implemented in system krb5 libraries exists from
longer than Samba has implemented those capabilities, I do not think it
make sense to reason along those lines.

GSS-Proxy has been built with a protocol to talk from the kernel that
resolved a number of issues for knfsd (eg big packet sizes when a MS-
PAC is present).

And Samba uses internally exactly the same krb5 mechanism as it defers
to the kerberos libraries as well.

Additionally GSS-Proxy can be very easily extended to also do NTLMSSP
using the same interface as I have built the gssntlmssp long ago from
the MS spec, and is probably the most correct NTLMSSP implementation
you can find around.

Gssntlmssp also has a Winbind backend so you get automaticaly access to
whatever cached credentials Winbindd has for users as a bonus (although
the integration can be improved there), yet you *can* use it w/o
Winbindd just fine providing a credential file (smbpasswd format
compatible).

GSS-Proxy is already integrated in distributions because it is used by
knfsd, and can be as easily used by cifsd, and you *should* really use
it there, so we can have a single, consistent, maintained, mechanism
for server side GSS authentication, and not have to repeat and reinvent
kernel to userspace mechanisms.

And if you add it for cifsd you have yet another reason to do it for
cifs.ko as well.

Finally the GSS-Proxy mechanism is namespace compatible, so you also
get the ability to define different auth daemons per different
containers, no need to invent new mechanisms for that or change yet
again protocols/userspace to obtain container capabilities.

For the client we'll need to add some XDR parsing functions in kernel,
they were omitted from my original patches because there was no client
side kernel consumer back then, but it i an easy, mechanical change.

HTH,
Simo.

The former uses a custom upcall interface to talk to cifs.spnego from cifs-utils. The latter then goes looking for Kerberos ticket caches using libkrb5 functions, not GSSAPI, which prevents gssproxy from interacting with it.[2]

The kernel could then, at least optionally, talk to gssproxy directly to try and obtain credentials.
