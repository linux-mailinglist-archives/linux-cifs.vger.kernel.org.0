Hi Tom,

What I meant by my statement was that this change does not modify the
decision about which server interface the channels are connected to.

You are right about what iface_cmp does.
The goal of this function was to compare two interfaces, and return 1
if interface 'a' is more preferred; 0 if both are the same; and -1 if
b is preferred.
The one that is preferred sits closer to the head of the list after
parse_server_interfaces.
The "preference" is based on 3 factors:
1. speed
2. rdma_capable
3. rss_capable
I missed the case where interfaces could have both rdma and rss
capability. Will fix that soon.

Do you see any problem if channels of the same session mix rdma/rss
capable interfaces?
I've kept the overall logic the same as before my changes.

If the server returns interfaces of different speeds, the end result
of parse_server_interfaces is in decreasing order of speed; then rdma
capable; then rss capable interfaces.
The protocol does not require this. But the implementation we had
always chose to connect to the fastest interfaces first.

Again, do you see a problem in mixing the interfaces, if we make
connections based on the speed of the connection?
I plan to change this logic to do a weighted distribution of channels
among interfaces (weight decided by speed of the interface), instead
of simply choosing the fastest one.
That way, parse_server_interfaces will not need to sort anymore.

It should not be necessary.

I spoke to Steve about this yesterday. He doesn't mind doing away with
the old logic of simple round robin too.
However, when in-flight == 0 for all channels, he feels that we should
not favour the same channel all the time.
So I'm planning to make some modifications to the current code in that
direction.
