It is because internally in the kernel API setting this timestamps is
a path based call.
We could search for and see if there is a writeable open handle and
use that IF there is such handle but it would be more code and
complexity.

It was just easier to make it into a compound. It should be cheap
enough and have no ill effects.

Ok, fair enough.
So if the filesystem has heuristics that can cause it to allocate
extra blocks like that (not unreasonable)
then it just means that these xfstests make assumptions about the
filesystem that are just not guaranteed to be true
when used with cifs.

That is fair enough. It just means there is no bug. It is just that
the test tool is not compatible with ntfs.
I can live with that. I do run it against btrfs and there I get the
result to allow me to run this part of the test in
the regression testsuite. That is good enough for me.
