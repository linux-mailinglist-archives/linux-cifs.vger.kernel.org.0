Removing ARC4 does work, at least against windows servers.
But it comes at the cost that we can not do key exchange, which
weakens the authentication.

Thinking about it, removing ARC4 because people want to make the
kernel "more secure"
would come at a cost of making cifs "less secure" :-(

The same situation, removal, exist for MD4 which is a core part of
NTLMSSP and can not be
disabled without full removal of NTLMSSP in its entirety.
For that case it was suggested that we "fork the md4 code and move it
into fs/cifs".


I don't think it is viable to remove NTLMSSP from the cifs module as
this would in reality
break cifs for most users so the only viable option might be that we
have to create a private fork of this.
And if we are already going to fork md4 and copy it into fs/cifs we
can just as well do the same for ARC4.

There are other modules depending on md4 too that can not disable it
without breaking all the users that need it
so I guess they will have to do the same.

I imagine that the kernel will then end up with no single common md4
hash in its cryptographic library
but several identical private copies of the md4 code in different modules.
lol
