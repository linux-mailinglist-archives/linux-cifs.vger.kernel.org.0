Hi all,

This patch is the (apparent) correct way to fix the issues regarding some
messages with invalid signatures. My previous patch
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cifs/20220918235442.2981-1-ematsumiya@suse.de/
was wrong because a) it covered up the real issue (*), and b) I could never
again "reproduce" the "race" -- I had other patches in place when I tested it,
and (thus?) the system memory was not in "pristine" conditions, so it's very
likely that there's no race at all.

(*) Thanks a lot to Tom Talpey for pointing me to the right direction here.

Since it sucks to be wrong twice, I'm sending this one as RFC because I
wanted to confirm some things:

  1) Can I rely on the fact that status != STATUS_SUCCESS means no variable
     data in the message?  I could only infer from the spec, but not really
     confirm.
  
  2) (probably only in async cases) When the signature fails, for whatever
     reason, we don't take any action.  This doesn't seem right IMHO,
     e.g. if the message is spoofed, we show a warning that the signatures
     doesn't match, but I would expect at least for the operation to stop,
     or maybe even a complete dis/reconnect.

  3) For SMB1, I couldn't really use generic/465 as a real confirmation for
     this because it says "O_DIRECT is not supported".  From reading the
     code and 'man mount.cifs' I understood that this is supported, so what
     gives?  Worth noting that I don't follow/use/test SMB1 too much.
     The patch does work for other cases I tried though.

I hope someone can address my questions/concerts above, and please let me
know if the patch is technically and semantically correct.

Patch follows.

--------
When verifying a response's signature, the computation will go through
the iov buffer (header + response structs) and the over the page data, to
verify any dynamic data appended to the message (usually on an SMB2 READ
response).

When the response is an error, however, specifically on async reads,
the page data is allocated before receiving the expected data.  Being
"valid" data (from the signature computation POV; non-NULL, >0 pages),
it's included in the parsing and generates an invalid signature for the
message.

Fix this by checking if the status is non-zero, and skip the page data
if it is.  The issue happens in all protocol versions, and this fix
applies to all.

This issue can be observed with xfstests generic/465.
