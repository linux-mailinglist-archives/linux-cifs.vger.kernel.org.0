Hi Michael,
as you say the best course of action would be for cifs.ko to move to
use the RPC interface we defined for knfsd (with any extensions that
may  be needed), and we had discussions in the past with cifs upstream
developers about it. But nothing really materialized.

If something is needed in the short term, I thjink the quickest course
of action is indeed to change the userspace helper to use gssapi
function calls, so that they can be intercepted like we do for rpc.gssd
(nfs client's userspace helper).

Unfortunately I do not have the cycles to work on that myself at this
time :-(

HTH,
Simo.

The former uses a custom upcall interface to talk to cifs.spnego from cifs-utils. The latter then goes looking for Kerberos ticket caches using libkrb5 functions, not GSSAPI, which prevents gssproxy from interacting with it.[2]

The kernel could then, at least optionally, talk to gssproxy directly to try and obtain credentials.
