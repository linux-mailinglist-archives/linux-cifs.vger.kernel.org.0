In the case of my Chelsio device, Need to set it to about
512K(512*1024 - 64) for it to work.
The 1048512 value seems insufficient to cover all devices. Is there
any other way to set the minimum read/write value? Calibrate this
minimum value by looking at
the device information? For example variables in ib_dev->attrs.
