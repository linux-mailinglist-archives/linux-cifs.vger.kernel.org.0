It's reasonable to fail a request that can never have sufficient
credits to send, but EOPNOTSUPP is a really strange error to return.
The operation might work if the payload were smaller, right? So,
would a resource error such as EDEADLK be more meaningful, and allow
the caller to recover, even?

Also, can you elaborate on why this is only triggered when no
requests at all are in flight? Or is this some kind of corner
case for requests that need every credit the server currently
is offering?

Tom.
