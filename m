Thanks Aur=C3=A9lien for your professional information. It's very detailed =
and
useful.

Now I can see the multiple channel info in network package when mount with
option "max_channel=3D2". If doesn't specify it. Client will only open one=
=20
channel. And my smb.conf setup below can work for multichannel. Seems serve=
r
and client don't require multiple network interfaces. And also don't need=
=20
network team.

But When test seedup, it isn't change. I use two vm in the same host. And
each have 4 cpu and 1G memory. Maybe it's the problem.

Thanks so much.
