Discussed this with Aurelien.

We both agreed that this will be a cleaner way to deal with the issue.
However, he pointed to me that the code changes will be more than what
I initially thought.
That needs more investigation.

The most likely case to hit the problem of EDEADLK is when the first
request on the channel is bigger than what we need.
The proposed fix should avoid that for basic requests by switching
channels (pending testing).
However, a large read/write could still result in EDEADLK error being retur=
ned.

Shyam
