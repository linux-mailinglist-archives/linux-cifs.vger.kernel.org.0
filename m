To clarify the differences you see:
1) on the smb2 session setup requests you see the working client
(smbclient) setting the SMB2_FLAGS_PRIORITY flags (this shouldn't make
any difference because it is SMB3.1.1 specific flag unless the server
negotiated smb3.1.1)
2) you see CAP_DFS (0x00000001) not CAP_EXTENDED_SECURITY (0x80000000)
set on the Capabilities field of the session setup response (the
negotiate protocol request if you specify vers=3D3 or vers=3D3.1 or
vers=3D3.1.1 or vers=3D3.0 should show these capabilities set on the
negotiate protocol request:

SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_DFS | SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_LEASING |
SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_LARGE_MTU | SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_PERSISTENT_HANDLES |
SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_ENCRYPTION | SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_DIRECTORY_LEASING

Would also be interesting to see if the signing required difference is rela=
ted.

I could give you a patch that forces the Capabilities field to include
more flags on session setup - it is easy enough to change the line
(round line 1181 of smb2pdu.c) - see SMB2_sess_alloc_buffer

req->Capabilities =3D 0;

to req_capabilities =3D SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_DFS;
