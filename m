I've been using the cpython source to test, 
https://github.com/python/cpython.  Just a plain ./configure and make -j4.  
But it seems to affect any substantial build process, I was also able to 
trigger it with coreutils build, really anything that generates I/O load.

Here's what my effective mount options look like:
type cifs 
(rw,nosuid,relatime,vers=1.0,cache=strict,username=nobody,uid=30000,forceuid,gid=30000,forcegid,addr=fd05:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001,soft,unix,posixpaths,serverino,mapposix,acl,reparse=nfs,rsize=1048576,wsize=65536,bsize=1048576,retrans=1,echo_interval=60,actimeo=1,closetimeo=1)
