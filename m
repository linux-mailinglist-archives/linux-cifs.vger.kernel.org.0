Subject: Re: [PATCH] SMB3.1.1: do not log warning message if server doesn't
 populate salt

If negotiate fails, due to server bug or packet corruption it would be
quite confusing if we silently fail with no indication of a server
problem.  ... And "warn_once" is used to avoid flooding the logs.   It
is quite common that these "warn_once" errors can be useful in problem
determination.  Typically when there are problems with the client
accessing a server we ask for the contents of dmesg and this kind of
thing (indications of unexpected behavior) can be helpful in problem
determination.   Currently if the preauth context is broken we can
guess that they wanted SHA512 but there is a risk if we guessed wrong
(eg server adds new algorithms in the future and breaks us due to
client or server bug) and don't note it in some way because the admin
would have nothing to report.   Logging to dmesg is something the user
generally would  not see on mount, but is useful for problem
determination and low risk.
