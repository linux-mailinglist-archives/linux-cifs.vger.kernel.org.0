Either a keytab or a ccache can be used. If a user is interactively no
the system and have created a ccache that can be used directly.

An unpolished PoC patch is attached. (Sorry, for not putting it inline, have to rock the groupware at work. I will try to sort that once we've agreed this is the/a way to go.)

After further testing it seems this is generally not allowed or just not working due to never being tested because it is unnecessary: If we can acquire a impersonation credential for that identity we should also be able to get the actual access credential as well.

The former uses a custom upcall interface to talk to cifs.spnego from cifs-utils. The latter then goes looking for Kerberos ticket caches using libkrb5 functions, not GSSAPI, which prevents gssproxy from interacting with it.[2]
