Hi Pavel,

Sorry for the late review on this. A few minor comments on __smb_send_rqst(=
):

    if ((total_len > 0) && (total_len !=3D send_length)) { <<<< what's
special about total_len =3D=3D 0? I'm guessing send_length will also be 0
in such a case.
        cifs_dbg(FYI, "partial send (wanted=3D%u sent=3D%zu): terminating
session\n",
             send_length, total_len);
        /*
         * If we have only sent part of an SMB then the next SMB could
         * be taken as the remainder of this one. We need to kill the
         * socket so the server throws away the partial SMB
         */
        server->tcpStatus =3D CifsNeedReconnect;
        trace_smb3_partial_send_reconnect(server->CurrentMid,
                          server->hostname);
    }

I'm not an expert on kernel socket programming, but if total_len !=3D
sent_length, shouldn't we iterate retrying till they become equal (or
abort if there's no progress)?
I see that we cork the connection before send, and I guess it's
unlikely why only a partial write will occur (Since these are just
in-memory writes).
But what is the reason for reconnecting on partial writes?

smbd_done:
    if (rc < 0 && rc !=3D -EINTR)   <<<<< Not very critical, but
shouldn't we also check for rc !=3D -ERESTARTSYS?
        cifs_server_dbg(VFS, "Error %d sending data on socket to server\n",
             rc);
    else if (rc > 0)
        rc =3D 0;

    return rc;
}

Regards,
Shyam
