Hi Satadru,

The attached dmesg did not have cifsFYI enabled.
Please use the below steps to enable cifsFYI before the sleep:
# echo 'module cifs +p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
# echo 'file fs/cifs/* +p' > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
# echo 7 > /proc/fs/cifs/cifsFYI

You can disable it after the repro using this cmd:
# echo 0 > /proc/fs/cifs/cifsFYI

-- 
Regards,
Shyam
