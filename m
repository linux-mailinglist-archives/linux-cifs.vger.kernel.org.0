A slightly more complex implementation might be that
when you add a directory to the cache you set an initial, relatively
short timeout,
maybe 3 seconds, before it expires.
Then every time a directory is accessed while in the cache, you reset
the timeout
to double the expiry time up to a maximum of 30 seconds/60 seconds/...

That way a hot directory will relatively quickly become sticky while a
cold directory is kicked out
after just 3 seconds or so or whatever the initial short timeout is set to.


Probably would need a good set of data and real tests to tweak these
values and understand what
good defaults would be.
Probably would be a good idea with a bunch of dbench scripts to create
and perform some I/O resembling
common application workloads on sets of a few tens of thousands of
directories and measure cache-hit rate
as well as wall-clock time to run each test. Maybe also compare with
test runs agains a target with very roundtrip
versus very high roundtrips. And some mixture between the ratio of hot
vs cold directories.

To be realistic I think the total set of directories in the test would
need to be orders of magnitude
larger than the number of directories that can fit in the cache.
