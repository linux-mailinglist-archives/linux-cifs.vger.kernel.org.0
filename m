Please see v4 change list in this cover letter
  - use work->response_sz for out_buf_len calculation in smb2_ioctl.
  - split smb2_set_info patch into two patches(declaring...

I didn't apply "SQUASH: at this layer we should only against the
MAX_STREAM_PROT_LEN =E2=80=A6"
because smb2 header is used before ksmbd_verify_smb_message is reached.
See init_rsp_hdr and check_user_session() in __handle_ksmbd_work().

Have you checked my comments on your squash patches of github ?
I didn't get any response from you :)

ksmbd is checking whether session id and tree id are vaild in smb
header before processing smb requests. is_chained_smb2_message is
checking next command header size.

Where ? You are saying your patch in github ? If it is right, I didn't drop=
.

I saw your patch and it's nice. However, we have not yet agreed on
where the review will be conducted. You also didn't respond to my
comments on my squash patch in your github. So I thought I'd take a
deeper look if you send the patch to the list.
