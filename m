FWIW: I can second that: Many of our clients (as in customers) run (for
example) Linux HPC cluster headnodes with directly attached storage. For th=
em,
exporting a local filesystem like ext4 or XFS via NFS *and* SMB is an impor=
tant
use-case.

They don't have the time and expertise to dive into VFS modules and quirks =
of
NFSv4-to-POSIX-ACL mappings. So they actually limit themselves to just
standard permission bits and write cron jobs to regularly reset permissions=
.
Even if we manage to come up with a working setup for them, it's going to b=
e
fragile in multiple dimensions. It's a pain.

Having consistent and powerful ACL support and enforcement across all acces=
s
paths (remote shell, NFS, SMB) that just works would be a huge leap forward=
 for
them. Having cp -a retain the ACLs and their effects during copy from NFS m=
ount
to local /tmp and back to an SMB mount would be a dream come true.

Thanks,
Michael

let's stop calling them RichACLs becuase that was only the name that Andrea=
s
Gr=FCnbacher was giving his implementation of the NFS4 ACLs, which however =
never
mede it upstream to the kernel. Andreas is no longer interested in working =
on
those actually because because of a long lack of interest by the Kernel
maintainers back in those days. In any case, NFS4 ACLs are the right name, =
even
if the SMB people don't like the "NFS" in the name.

We have a summary of the state of NFS4 ACLs here:
https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwiki.sa=
mba.org%2Findex.php%2FNFS4_ACL_overview&data=3D05%7C01%7Cmichael.weiser%40a=
tos.net%7C359c5b89a4aa453c20c108db5e02cb6a%7C33440fc6b7c7412cbb730e70b0198d=
5a%7C0%7C0%7C638207138314989061%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDA=
iLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=3D96X=
1GeVCoPYo1s3wmxtiDMdnXkR%2Bn%2Bw%2BcVfILLB3HGo%3D&reserved=3D0 . I recommen=
d taking a
closer look at this.

If cifs.ko would add a mapping of SMB ACLs to the corresponding system.nfs4=
_acl
EA, this would be nice already but It will only be a limited help if cifs.k=
o.

The NFS4 ACL model needs to be supported by the Linux kernel also to be rea=
lly
helpful. The nfs4-acl-tools are there to manage NFS4 ACLs already. To becom=
e
really helpful for Linux NFS4 ACLs need to be managable natively and also b=
e
supported with generic filesystems and tools.

I've seen people who abandon to use Linux as client machines because of the
lack of ACL managability. Have in mind that the so called POSIX ACLs are no=
t a
standardized permission model. The POSIX ACLs never passed the status of a
draft standard and the only standardized ACL permission model are in fact t=
he
NFS4 ACLs. One of the main reason why FreeNAS or TrueNAS these days are bas=
ed
on FreeBSD is the lack of NFS4 ACLs also.

I really wonder why the responsible people in the Kernel developer communit=
y
ignore this important topic since so many years. Would be nice to see them =
join
this thread ...
