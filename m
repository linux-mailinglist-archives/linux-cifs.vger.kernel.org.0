Yes. But even if we knew where the data starts, it will not be aligned
to a page anyway so we need to memcpy() it anyway.

But I think it is possible, with a lot of effort. And probably not
worth the effort.

But, I have been toying with the idea of trying to do "zero-copy" SMB2
READ in libsmb2.
It, does read all the unencrypted READ payloads straight into the
application buffer without a copy
already, but just like cifs.ko it uses an intermediate buffer for
encrypted packets.And thus an extra memcpy()

The solution I was thinking of would be something like :
1, Read the first 4 + 64 bytes into a buffer.  This will be
enough to hold, either
1a, unencrypted case:
      inspect the SMB2 header to find the opcode, then read the
response header  (16 bytes for smb2 read/write responses)
      then read the payload straight into the application buffer.
      I do this already and it works without too much pain.
      Now we are finished for the unencrypted case.
2, encrypted case:
      In this case we have the full transform header and also part of
an encrypted smb2 header.
      We know how big the transform header is so we can copy the
partial smb2 header into a 64 byte
      temp buffer and then read the remaining part of the smb2 header.
3,   Start decryption, but only run it for the first 64 bytes, i.e.
the smb2 header.
3a, OPCODE !=3D READ: Inspect the decrypted smb2 header, IF it is NOT a
read response then just read all remaining data into
      a temp buffer, continue the decryption and handle it the normal way.
4,   If the opcode is a READ, then read an additional 16 bytes into a
temp buffer and continue the decryption of these 16 bytes.
5,   What follows now is the read response payload so read this
decrypted data straight into the application buffer (or pages)
      and again, continue the decryption and decrypt the data in-place.
      Voila, zero-copy encrypted read handling.  Which would really
help on a PS2 since memcpy() is pretty expensive on its very slow
memory.


I think this would work, and it would be very interesting to implement.
Not sure if it is worth it to do in kernel code because there will be
hairy special conditions to handle.


For kernel code I think it would be better/safer to have fast hw
offload for memcpy()
