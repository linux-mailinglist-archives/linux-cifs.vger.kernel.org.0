Spent some time in this code path. Seems like this is more complicated
than I initially thought.
@Aur=C3=A9lien Aptel A few things to consider:
1. What if the credits that will be needed by the request is more than
3 (or any constant). We may still end up returning -EDEADLK to the
user when we don't find enough credits, and there are not enough
in_flight to satisfy the request. Ideally, we should still try other
channels.
2. Echo and oplock use 1 reserved credit each, which the regular
operations can steal, in case of shortage.
3. Reading server->credits without a lock can result in wildly
different values, since some CPU architectures may not update it
atomically. At worse, we may select a channel which may not have
enough credits when we get to it.

What if we do this...
wait_for_compound_request() can return -EDEADLK when it doesn't get
enough credits, and there are no requests in_flight.
In compound_send_recv(), after we call wait_for_compound_request(), we
can check it's return value. If it's -EDEADLK, we keep calling
cifs_pick_another_channel(ses, bitmask) (bitmask has bits set for
channels already selected and rejected) and
wait_for_compound_request() in a loop till we find a channel which has
enough credits, or we run out of channels; in which case we can return
-EDEADLK.
Makes sense? Do you see a problem with that approach?

Regards,
Shyam
