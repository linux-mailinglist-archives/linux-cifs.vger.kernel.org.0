Good question - I am testing it right now and weighing the option of
the one line patch which fixes at least one of the problems, vs. the
longer patch (about 50 lines of code IIRC) of Shyam's that I am
testing now.    We will defer the larger changes Ronnie, Shyam and I
have discussed to make the state machine more readable/understandable
(and less likely to run into this in the future by changing the state
names in the enum) for the three structures (server socket we are
connected to, authenticated user session, tree connect for the share
we have mounted)
