It does make more sense to me at this point to just broadly assume all
ARPHRD_INFINIBAND types to be RDMA-capable, we just need to make sure
this assumption indeed holds and figure out to what extent this could
involve the same layering violation.

I would agree that the design direction to treat ipoib as a pure
regular net_device is the good way to go. But the problem with ksmbd
and ipoib devices stems from the SMB protocol itself.

In contrast to protocols that focus on certain functionalities like
nfs, SMB actually tries to manage network interfaces actively in the
protocol itself: SMB protocol's RDMA support (dubbed SMB Direct) is a
sub-feature of SMB Multichannel. Multichannel is designed to let
client and server find multiple data paths automatically (imagine a
pair of hosts with multiple adapters connected by multiple cables) to
increase bandwidth. So client can initiate a
FSCTL_QUERY_NETWORK_INTERFACE_INFO request and server is expected to
respond with NETWORK_INTERFACE_INFO containing _all_ local network
interface informations, including their capabilities such as
RDMA_CAPABLE (for details see ref [MS-SMB2] 3.3.5.15.11) Only upon
seeing the capability flag would a client attempt to initiate a RDMA
connection.

Reference: [MS-SMB2](https://winprotocoldoc.z19.web.core.windows.net/MS-SMB=
2/%5bMS-SMB2%5d.pdf)

TLDR is that the SMB protocol requires the server to enumerate all
net_devices and indicate their RDMA capability, and
ksmbd_rdma_capable_netdev() is only used in that process. Given such
context, I wonder what should be the best way to approach this? Is
using ARPHRD_INFINIBAND good enough and acceptable in terms of
layering?
