Ronnie does make a good point about the error returned to the user.
However, masking all the errors returned from the
cifs_construct_tcon() doesn't sit well with me.

For example, if the system is low on memory, or there's an EIO
returned due to some reason, those errors will not make it to the
user, and the user will see a blanket "Permission denied". How many
Linux users will check the dmesg/logs when they get an EACCES?

Moreover, if the actual returned is ENOMEM but we return EACCES to the
user, we could have a situation where the user gets EACCES for one I/O
but no such error for the subsequent I/O. This can be quite confusing
for the user.

Opinions?

Regards,
Shyam
