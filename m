->s_blocksize will be set to 4K on 4K native.
If you check v2 patch, the sector size is set to min(->s_blocksize, 4096).

value x is ->s_blocksize in NTFS of linux kernel.

I think that setting it to fixed logical 512B, physical 4K can report
the wrong sector size for 4K native storage. Because it has to be
logical 4K, physical 4K.
->s_blocksize is probably a good alternative, set 4K as the maximum
sector size for unusual ->s_blocksize like ZFS. Because I haven't seen
a device with hw sector size larger than 4K.
