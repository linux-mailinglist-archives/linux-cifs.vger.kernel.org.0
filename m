As discussed in the other email thread that Satadru started, I feel
that these two (multiuser regression and the sleep/resume issue) are
different issues.
Let's continue the discussion on that one in the dedicated email thread.

As for the multiuser regression, here's a slightly updated version of
my last patch here.
https://github.com/sprasad-microsoft/smb3-kernel-client/commit/9bc6cde4609c98cf53a5f3e0462c68708dbb54b7.patch

Steve, I leave it upto you whether you want to take for 5.17 or 5.18-rc1.
For 5.18-rc1, I'll have another patch on top of this one that should
fix parallel reconnects for multichannel for good. (I'm planning to
split up session status to individual channels there).

Regards,
Shyam
