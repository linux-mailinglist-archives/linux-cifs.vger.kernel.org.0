Hi,

On our production servers, we have a lot of issues with cifs mounts.
All mounts are mounted via the dfs shares on our domain controller.
We have mounts using sec=krb5, sec=ntlmssp and sec=krb5,multiuser

All mounts are vers=3.0.

One of the symptoms is that our monitoring system complains about not 
being able to stat() every now and then, the next scraping cycle, stat() 
works again. Even when the mounts are not accesses at all.

Also, lot of applications get stuck on either accessing data on the 
mounts, or performing stat() like operations on the mounts.

For us, the worst part is that applications end up in 'D'. The number of 
'D' processes pile up really quickly, blocking users from performing 
their work.

We are running Linux 4.20.17 SMP PREEMPT on all machines. We tried 
upgrading to > 5.x, but caused even more problems and kernel hangs.

I do not really have a clue where to start debugging. I enabled kernel 
debug options suggested on the wiki, but the amount of logging is 
immense now.

Can you provide any pointers where to look or start debugging?
Or any help on how to kill those D processes and get our Linux servers 
stable again?

Regards, Martijn de Gouw
