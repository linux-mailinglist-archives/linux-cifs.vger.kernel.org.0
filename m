Interesting. 512 credits doesn't seem like starvation, but it will
definitely stress a high workload. Good!

Sounds reasonable, but things might get a little tricky if the
server-side handle has a lease or some other state still attached.
A subsequent client create on the same file might encounter an
unexpected conflict? It's critical to think that through.

So by laundromat I meant background processing to handle the
close. It would have some sort of queued work list, and it
would process the work items and wash-dry-fold the results.

The main motivation would be to release the thread that fell
into the refcnt == 0 so the calling application may continue.
Stealing the thread for a full server roundtrip might be
worth avoiding, in all cases.

OTOH, if the tricky stuff above is risky or wrong, then forget
the laundromat and don't return until the close is done. But
then, think about ^C!
