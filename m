Hi Shyam,

In my scenario, gssproxy has a single keytab with its own machine/service i=
dentity (actually just /etc/krb5.keytab and machine$@REALM) that is allowed=
 to impersonate users, i.e. retrieve service tickets made out to user ident=
ities without obtaining a TGT for the respective user identity first.

When dealing with end-users, the option of having user-specific keytabs is =
IMO quite impractical because the keytabs would need updating on every pass=
word change.

For machine-to-machine communication accounts with static passwords could h=
ave keytabs and those could be under gssproxy's supervision and with additi=
onal hardening (SELinux?) cifs.upcall could even be prevented from having d=
irect access to them and only ever get the cifs service ticket it actually =
needs to function.

I understand cifscreds "pushes" credentials, i.e. the user's password, into=
 the kernel so it can log on to services as that user at any given point in=
 time. This works because the password is valid for days or weeks at a time=
 and works with multiple servers. Kerberos tickets usually expire after som=
e hours and need to be made out to specific target services/servers. So cif=
screds (or the new executable) would also need an option to specify the ser=
vice for which the user wants to push a credential into the kernel for and =
it'd need to be called repeatedly to refresh that ticket. This would somewh=
at limits its usefulness, IMO.

The benefit would be that users could explicitly specify the identity they =
wanted to use - so long as the user is actually doing the retrieving of the=
 credential and needs to authenticate for that.
In the case of impersonation by gssproxy this becomes tricky because gsspro=
xy needs to make sure that users can't just claim any identity. So the user=
 would need to authenticate to gssproxy somehow which (due to the ephemeral=
 nature of Kerberos tickets) would likely require it to become more statefu=
l or configurable, i.e. somehow know that uid 10012 is allowed to use ident=
ities alice@REALM and bob@REALM.

I was thinking about that as well and am still somewhat unsure how to best =
do it. rpc.gssd is going at it the other way around[2]: A config file optio=
n lets the user explicitly enable usage of gssproxy and rpc.gssd sets the v=
ariable to enable the functionality. cifs.upcall could have a command line =
option for that (and another to optionally specify a non-default socket).

The advantage would be that there's no cryptic variable-setting syntax to b=
e added to request-key's cifs.spnego.conf but just additional straightforwa=
rd command-line option(s). The downside is that it cements the GSS_USE_PROX=
Y variable into yet another executable.

I wonder, how the gssproxy team had intended this to be done. Simo?

Hi Michael,

What happens when credentials are not supplied in keytab files? Is
there a way to supply the credentials from other sources in that case?
The reason why I'm asking this is that this same code can be used by
cifscreds (or a new executable) to perform the authentication, and
collect the krb5 tickets.

Also, in the cifs.upcall changes, you could check for the
GSS_USE_PROXY env variable. In the absence of which, fallback to the
older code. If that is done, it gives the user an option to go for one
option or the other.
Other than that, the changes look fine to me.

Regards,
Shyam
