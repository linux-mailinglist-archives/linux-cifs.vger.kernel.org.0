Since this approach could be a huge performance degradation for some
(albeit rare)
workloads (e.g. if hardlinks exist for files, but such files are not opened=
 by
different names at the same time), I prefer the two phase approach
that simply retries when we get invalid argument without the lease key
(which has no risk since the current code just fails, and retry will "fix" =
the
issue albeit not as good as being able to cache the second open)

I don't like the idea of hurting caching for all hardlinked files as a hack=
,
so for the longer term solution I prefer a solution that caches the
dentry pointer with the lease key, although that brings up the obvious
question of whether the dentry could be freed and reallocated
in some deferred close cases and cause the lease key to be valid
but us not to match it due to new dentry).

I lean toward something like:
1) store the dentry for the lease key, not just the lease key in the
cifs inode info (today we only store the lease key).
We could store an array of lease key/dentry pairs but I worry that
this would run the risk of use after free and/or lock contention bugs
(and additional memory usage if a malicious app tried to open all
hardlinked files)
2) if link count is greater than 1, check that the dentry matches when
deciding whether to use the lease key (presumably
we don't have to worry about it link count is 1)
