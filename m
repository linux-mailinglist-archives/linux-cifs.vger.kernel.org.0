That is not fully truth. Crossing a mount point in mounted SMB share is
signaled by the new mount point over SMB and so the SMB client is
interpreting it like a new share and reading fs attributes for that
crossed path. Linux SMB client is already doing it and correctly handles
crossed mount points. It also shows crosses in the "mount" output. And
moreover it applies not only for SMB, but also for NFS.
And that is why FS attributes are per-share, not global server.

So the problem which you are describing does not and cannot happen.
