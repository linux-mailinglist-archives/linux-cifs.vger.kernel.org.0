I do not know if the kernel documents this, but the way gssproxy works
is that when you start the daemon it pokes at the kernel to let it know
the socket is available. So then the kernel opens the socket in the
namespace the proxy is running into (detected from the poking
operation, which is a write in a proc file).

HTH,
Simo.

The former uses a custom upcall interface to talk to cifs.spnego from cifs-utils. The latter then goes looking for Kerberos ticket caches using libkrb5 functions, not GSSAPI, which prevents gssproxy from interacting with it.[2]

The kernel could then, at least optionally, talk to gssproxy directly to try and obtain credentials.
