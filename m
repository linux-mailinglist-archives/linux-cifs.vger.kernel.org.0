Hi Sergey. The reasoning was in the commit message included in the
email, but I'll quote it here and elaborate:

- clearer user interface: having a single binary looks much clearer than
   having several separate programs when, e.g. the user is looking which
   program does what.

- more readable commands: continuing from topic above, the situation is
   improved especially when you see that, e.g., the ksmbd.addshare program
   also updates and deletes shares. With this unification, it is way more
   intuitive to use:

---- snip ----
% ./ksmbdctl share
Usage: ksmbdctl share <subcommand> <args> [options]
Share management.

List of available subcommands:
   add               Add a share
   delete            Delete a share
   update            Update a share
   list              List the names of all shares available
---- snip ----

- easier to script: having a defined structure for the commands makes it
   easier for users to automate ksmbd deployments. This is more of a
   consequence of the topics above, but should count as an advantage IMO.

As I also said in the commit message, the idea is to have an abstract
implementation so we can add/manage/remove commands without having to
rely on each command specifics. Of course, this shouldn't have much/any
effect for users, but will have great benefit for developers.

And, again, I ask you to consider the applications I used as inspiration
for such change, such as git, nvme-cli, virsh, which are tools that many
of us use every day and, e.g. "git help -a | grep "^   " | wc -l" says
there are about 144 git commands, but I sure don't have 144 git binaries
spread over my system.

I hope to have made myself clearer now, but please let me know
otherwise.


Cheers,

Enzo
