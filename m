The problem with a per-tcon workqueue is I didn't see clean way to deal with 
multiuser mounts and flushing the workqueue in close_all_cached_dirs() -- when 
dealing with each individual tcon, we're still holding tlink_tree_lock, so an 
arbitrary sleep seems problematic.

There could be a per-sb workqueue (stored in cifs_sb or the master tcon) but 
is there a way to get back to the superblock / master tcon with just a tcon 
(e.g. cached_dir_lease_break, when processing a lease break)?

In the existing code (and my patch, without the refs), I was seeing an 
intermittent use-after-free of the tcon or cached_fids struct by queued work 
processing a lease break -- the cfid isn't linked from cached_fids, but 
smb2_close_cached_fid invoking SMB2_close can race with the unmount and 
cifs_put_tcon

Something like:

     t1                              t2
cached_dir_lease_break
smb2_cached_lease_break
smb2_close_cached_fid
SMB2_close starts
                                     cifs_kill_sb
                                     cifs_umount
                                     cifs_put_link
                                     cifs_put_tcon
SMB2_close continues

I had a version of the patch that kept the 'in flight lease breaks' on 
a second list in cached_fids so that they could be cancelled synchronously 
from free_cached_fids(), but I struggled with it (I can't remember exactly, 
but I think I was struggling to get the linked list membership / removal 
handling and num_entries handling consistent).

The dentries being dropped must occur before kill_anon_super(), as that's 
where the 'Dentry still in use' check is. All the tcons are put in 
cifs_umount(), which occurs after:

     kill_anon_super(sb);
     cifs_umount(cifs_sb);

The other thing is that cifs_umount_begin() has this comment, which made me 
think a tcon can actually be tied to two distinct mount points:

         if ((tcon->tc_count > 1) || (tcon->status == TID_EXITING)) {
                 /* we have other mounts to same share or we have
                    already tried to umount this and woken up
                    all waiting network requests, nothing to do */

Although, as I'm thinking about it again, I think I've misunderstood (and that 
comment is wrong?).

It did cross my mind to pull some of the work out of cifs_umount into 
cifs_kill_sb (specifically, I wanted to cancel prune_tlinks earlier) -- no 
prune_tlinks would make it more feasible to drop tlink_tree_lock in 
close_all_cached_dirs(), at which point a per-tcon workqueue is more 
practical.

After I finish with my tests (I'm not using xfstests, although perhaps 
I should be) and unmount the share, DebugData doesn't show any connections for 
me.
