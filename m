I think you mean once the "file descriptor" is closed, right? But now
that you mention it, caching the attributes sounds a lot like the
NFS close-to-open semantic, which is itself optional with the "nocto"
mount option.

Because some applications use close() to perform flush, there may be
some silent side effects as well. I don't see anything special in the
patch regarding this. Have you considered it?

The change to promptly close the handle on oplock or lease break looks
reasonable. The rewording in the patch description is better too.

Yes, because I expect the client to attempt to reclaim its handles upon
reconnection. I don't see any particular code change regarding this.

My question is, if there's a deferred close pending, should it do that,
or should it simply cut to the chase and close any such handle(s)?
