Subject: [PATCH 0/4] Start moving common cifs/ksmbd definitions into a common directory

Steve, Namjae,

Here is a start of work to share common definitions between the cifs client and the server.
The patches build ontop of Namjaes patch to rework the smb2_hdr structure
that he recently sent to the list.

It creates a new shared smb2pdu.h file and starts moving definitions over.
The two copies of smb2pdu.h, in cifs/ and ksmbd/ have diverged a bit
so some things are being renamed in these patches.
NegotiateProtocol is in two separate patches since for this funciton the
changes are a little more than just renames, for example I change several
arrays at the tail of structures from [number] to simply []
so that needs careful review.

Two patches are for cifs and cifs_common and two patches are for ksmbd.
The ksmbd patches depend on the cifs patches so the cifs patches have to go in first.
