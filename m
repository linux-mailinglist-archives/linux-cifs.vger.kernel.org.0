Channels are absolutely a property of the session. Server multichannel
enables their use, but the decision to actually use them is per-session.

That sounds wrong. Normally we want to share connections, to preserve
resources. Howe3ver, for certain greedy flows, it may be a good idea to
create dedicated channels (connections). This is a policy decision, and
should not be wired-in.

Yes and no. There are similar reasons to avoid using pooled channels.
Performance is one obvious one - some connections may be faster (RDMA),
or tuned for specific advantages (lower latency, more secure). Selection
of channel should allow for certain types of filtering.

Yes, absolutely. Shared channels require careful processing when a
disconnect is used. It's incredibly rude to close a shared connection.

This makes sense, but only if the channel selection is sensibly
filterable. A non-RDMA mount should not be selecting an RDMA
channel. An encrypted share may want to prefer an adapter which
can support bus or CPU affinity. Etc.

That's part of it, definitely. "Fastest" is hard to measure. Fast
as in latency? Bandwidth? CPU overhead?

Yup. RSS is only a hint. It's not a metric.

RSS is only meaningful on the machine doing the receiving, in this
case, the server. The client has no clue how to optimize that. But
assuming a handful of RSS queues is a good idea. Personally I'd
avoid a number as large as 8. But over time, cores are increasing,
so it's a crapshoot.

16 seems high, especially on a gigabit interface. At hundreds of Gb,
well, that's possibly different. I'd avoid making too many assumptions
(guesses!).
