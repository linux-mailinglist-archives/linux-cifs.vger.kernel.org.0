While I understand the concern that having too many options can be
confusing for users, these are the most fine grained tuning knobs
available to us.
Anything else today (procfs entry, module parameter etc) are not at
the level of each mounted filesystem.
As Steve said, this could be configured by advanced users, based on
the workload. The default should be good enough for regular users.
The patch looks good to me.

For the number of mount options the user has at his/her disposal, I
feel that we should work on a profile=X mount option.
Based on the value of X, which describes the user workload, we could
internally decide on the values of multiple fine tunable mount
options.
We should have a smaller set of values for X, based on different type
of workloads, and the default values of other mount options based on
this value.
Thoughts?
