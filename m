Hello Steve,

the goal of struct smb2_compound_op is to make it easier to work with
compound requests. In particular the existing smb2_compound_op()
function in smb2inode.c is very hard to understand, let alone
modify. As an example it took me really a long time to get
64ce47cb1b29d7d6aab6 right, and I still see it as a very clumsy
approach. It should not be neccesary to kmemdup output deep inside
this routine, but it was the only approach I could find.

To me it would be much easier if the open/qinfo/close sequence was
flat in smb311_posix_query_path_info() and we could dissect the
results while the response is still around.

So yes, this fs/cifs/smb2compound.c is 200 lines of code, but I think
it is really simply structured code that should be easy to review.

Volker
