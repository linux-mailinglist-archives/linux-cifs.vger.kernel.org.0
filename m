Here's the updated version of the patch:
https://github.com/sprasad-microsoft/smb3-kernel-client/commit/ea9b6b0d65756e55e4f6b89313da6bda61687929.patch
@Steve French @Tom Talpey Please review.

I'm working on another patch for interface selection while creating a
new channel.
Will send that out soon.
