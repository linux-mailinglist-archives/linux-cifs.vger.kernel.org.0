No, that's no what I meant.

It is indeed clear, but inode space is quite expensive, so we cannot
add i_fsnotify_remote_mask field for all inodes and also its not
necessary.

TBH, I do have a final picture of the opt-in API and there are several
shapes that it could take.

I think that we anyway need an "event mask flag" FAN_REMOTE,
similar to FAN_ONDIR.

A remote notification is generated by the filesystem and this source
of notification always sets the FS_REMOTE in the event mask, which is
visible to users reading the events.

This makes it natural to also opt-in for remote events via the mask,
some as is done with FAN_ONDIR.

However, I would like to avoid the complexities involved with flipping
this FS_REMOTE bit in event mask, that's why I was thinking about
FAN_MARK_REMOTE that sets a flag in the mark, like FAN_MARK_EVICTABLE
and forces all mark updates to use the same flag.

But for your first RFC, I suggest that you make it simple and use
a group flag to request only remote notifications at fanotify_init
time.

This way you can take the existing cifs implementation of remote
notifications using an ioctl and "bind" it to use the fanotify API
with as little interferance with local notifications as possible.

Not quite there yet :)

This is not what I was looking for.

What I am looking for is a POC patch of binding cifs notifications
to fsnotify/fanotify:

- fanotify_mask() calls filesystem method to update server event mask
- filesystem calls fnsotify() hook with FS_REMOTE flag
- groups or marks that did not opt-in for remote notifications
  would drop this event

First milestone: be able to write program that listens to remote
notifications only.

Same program can use two groups remote and local with mask per type
to request a mixture of local and remote events.

Honestly, I don't think we need more than that?

Thanks,
Amir.
