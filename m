This is something I have an interest in, but haven't had time to pursue.
The readahead code gets this information because the page cache
calls page_cache_sync_ra() if it needs this page right now, and calls
page_cache_async_ra() if it thinks it will need the page in the future.

ondemand_readahead() currently gets a true/false parameter
(hit_readahead_marker), although my folio patches change it to pass in
a folio or NULL.  That is then *not* passed to the filesystem, but it
could be information passed in the ractl.

There's also some tidying-up to be done around faulting.  Currently
fault-around doesn't have a way to express "read me all the pages around
page N".  Instead it just assumes that pages N-R/2 to N+R/2 are the
right ones to fetch when it should be left up to the filesystem or the
readahead code to determine what window of pages to fetch.

Another thing I have an interest in doing but not had opportunity to
pursue is making ->readpage synchronous.  The current MM code always
calls ->readahead first and only calls ->readpage if ->readahead fails.
That means that all the async ->readpage work is actually wrong; we
want to return the best error possible from ->readpage, even if that
means sleeping.

Oh ... except for swap.  For NFS only, it calls ->readpage, so it really
wants ->readpage to be async so it can kick off multiple pages and
then wait for the one it actually needs.  That gets into a conversation
about how much we really care about swap-over-NFS, whether swap should
be using ->readpage or ->direct_IO, and whether swap should use the
file readahead code or its own virtual address based readahead code.
Most of those discussions are outside my area of expertise.
