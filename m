AFAICT, for a mount with N channels, whether DFS or not, there is a
wrong assumption that after failover, there will be N channels to be
reconnected.

There might be a case where the administrator disabled multichannel in
server settings, or decreased the number of available adapters, or if
the new DFS target doesn't support multichannel or has fewer channels.
In this case, cifs.ko would have stale channels trying to reconnect
indefinitely.

Please correct me if I missed something.
