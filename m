No errors, it's just that when the IOCTL have a 0 len, there can be
several messages printed when debugging. It wasn't that much, but enough
to get me confused several times.

Since they were completely unnecessary, I thought it was ok to not print it.

Yes. I'm always getting a lot of those mismatched length calculations
(Windows Server 2019). After investigating, I found that they were not
real mismatches (see below).

Yes, it could, but as I mention in the commit message, this would only
happen on the *real* mismatched cases, i.e. after passing all the checks
inside the "if (len != calc_len)" check. In those cases, I'd prefer to
really be aware of them then risk it getting lost in dmesg.


Cheers,

Enzo
