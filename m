Hi Tom,

As always, thanks for the detailed review. :)

The idea is to return consistent values for a given pair, so that, for
interfaces with exactly same advertised speeds, they're ordered based
on address family first, then based on what memcmp returns.

My familiarity with IPv6 is relatively low. Steve actually pointed me
to NFS client code which does a similar comparison. Let me redo this
part.

I could do that. But that only changes the order in which the
interfaces are ordered.
I think the place where you want this change more is where the
interface is actually getting selected for a new connection.
I'll do this.

Ok. I was not sure about whether they can co-exist, and decided to
make this extra comparison anyway.
Good that you shared this info. But I don't think this code hurts.

As explained above, this just decides the ordering of the interface list.
The items on the head of the list do get slight preference, the list
is first sorted based on speed, then on capabilities, then on family,
then on the actual value.

I understand your concern on this. And I can fix this.

So even for this case, no mixing?

I think I understood your concerns.
I'll address all these concerns with the next version of my patch and
then check if we're on the same page.
