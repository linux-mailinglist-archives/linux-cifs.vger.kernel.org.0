I installed linux 5.1.19 but that doesn't make a difference. It still
sets the DFS bit to 0 on the NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE and then when smbclient
does a FSCTL_DFS_GET_REFERRALS, mount.cifs does a "Tree connect
request tree" which fails with "STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME". After that
failure, it does do a FSCTL_DFS_GET_REFERRALS but it doesn't mount.
