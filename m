           Summary: EBADF/EIO errors in rename/open caused by race
                    condition in smb2_compound_op
           Product: CifsVFS

  Target Milestone: ---

There are two different scenarios where we encountered the EBADF/EIO errors=
:=20

- Write test, where there are multiple threads writing to a file with "_tem=
p"
suffix and after the write completes a rename happens that removes the "_te=
mp"
suffix. Each process/thread writes to a unique file, there are no overlaps.
Read test, where multiple threads attempt to choose a random file out of a
certain set and read it =E2=80=93 so here it can happen that multiple threa=
ds access
the same file at the same time. The error happens most often when the set of
files is small; for example, repeated reads of 5 different 20M files by 128
threads triggered this for us.
- Read test, where multiple threads attempt to choose a random file out of a
certain set and read it =E2=80=93 so here it can happen that multiple threa=
ds access
the same file at the same time. The error happens most often when the set of
files is small; for example, repeated reads of 5 different 20M files by 128
threads triggered this for us.

We believe the root cause for both of them is the same: there seems to be a
race condition in smb2_compound_op:

---
after_close:
        num_rqst++;

        if (cfile) {
                cifsFileInfo_put(cfile); // sends SMB2_CLOSE to the server
                cfile =3D NULL;
---

This code is triggered by smb2_query_path_info operation that happens during
revalidate_dentry. In smb2_query_path_info, get_readable_path is called to =
load
the cfile, increasing the reference counter. If in the meantime, this refer=
ence
becomes the very last, this call to cifsFileInfo_put(cfile) will trigger a
SMB2_CLOSE request sent to the server just before sending this compound req=
uest
=E2=80=93 and so then the compound request fails either with EBADF/EIO depe=
nding on the
timing at the server, because the handle is already closed.


In the first scenario, the race seems to be happening between
smb2_query_path_info triggered by the rename operation, and between =E2=80=
=9Ccleanup=E2=80=9D
of asynchronous writes =E2=80=93 while fsync(fd) likely waits for the async=
hronous
writes to complete, releasing the writeback structures can happen after the
close(fd) call. So the EBADF/EIO errors will pop up if the timing is such t=
hat:
1) There are still outstanding references after close(fd) in the writeback
structures
2) smb2_query_path_info successfully fetches the cfile, increasing the
refcounter by 1
3) All writeback structures release the same cfile, reducing refcounter to 1
4) smb2_compound_op is called with that cfile

In the second scenario, the race seems to be similar =E2=80=93 here open tr=
iggers the
smb2_query_path_info operation, and if all other threads in the meantime
decrease the refcounter to 1 similarly to the first scenario, again SMB2_CL=
OSE
will be sent to the server just before issuing the compound request. This c=
ase
is harder to reproduce across different machines and the timing is more tri=
cky,
so we attach a pseudocode for that case.

Proposed patch:

It seems to us that it should be sufficient and harmless to just remove the=
 two
lines:

cifsFileInfo_put(cfile);
cfile =3D NULL;

The cleanup happens anyways just below the call to compound_send_recv under=
 the
finished: label. Unless something in compound_send_recv can interfere with =
this
cleanup, it should be safe to remove them. In our testing we didn't encount=
er
any issues after removing them.
