thank you so much!

Certainly, I've compared my original patch with the commit on the
for-next branch, and the code change itself is completely equal to mine.

Here the patch is a regular plain test file created by git-format-patch
utility and sent by git-send-email. Apparently any issues were caused on
the next stage of editing the commit message, that's what the diff says.

Thank you again for review, I have a few more changes in my queue, they
are not as critical as this one, thus I'll send them at a slow rate.
