Thanks for sharing the slides, Samba over QUIC is indeed quite mature.

After reading the slides, I can understand how these two QUIC features
work in Samba:

- All packets are always encrypted and handshake is authenticated with TLS =
1.3
- Improved congestion control and loss recovery

But it seems not clear to me how some other features are used in samba:

- Parallel streams of reliable and unreliable application data

Multi-streaming:
How is Samba using the multi-streaming of QUIC? I saw there are Multichanne=
l
in Samba, but I'm not sure it's using multiple connections or multi-streami=
ng
in their implementation.

Unreliable application data:
Does Samba need to transmit unreliable data?

- Exchanges application data in the first round trip (0-RTT)

0-RTT: does Microsoft's Samba over QUIC implementation really support this?
As the handshake of linux in-kernel QUIC happens in userspace, 0-RTT
becomes difficult to implement.

- Survives a change in the clients IP address or port

Connection Migration: This could be a useful feature, but I don't see any
spec in the slides, has their implementation supported it?

Thanks.
