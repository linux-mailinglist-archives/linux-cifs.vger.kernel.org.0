(I'm pasting the patch here so I can comment inline)

Ok.

This is ok too, which is an approach that I did try before, but
didn't work (see below).

This is an incorrect assumption. keyutils' key.dns_resolve uses
getaddrinfo() for A/AAAA queries, which doesn't contain DNS TTL
information.

Meaning that the TTL returned to dns_resolve_server_name_to_ip() is
actually either key.dns_resolve.conf's default_ttl value, or the default
key_expiry value (5).

I have a patch ready (working, but still testing) for keyutils that implements
a "common" DNS interface, and the caller only specifies the query type,
which is then resolved via res_nquery(). This way, all returned records
have generic their metadata (TTL included), along with type-specific
metadata (e.g. AFSDB or SRV specifics) as well.

Another option/suggestion would be to:
1. decrease SMB_DNS_RESOLVE_INTERVAL_DEFAULT
2. and/or make it user-configurable via sysfs
3. call dns_query() with expiry=NULL and invalidate=true

So we'd use keyutils exclusively for kernel-userspace communication, and
handle the expiration checking/configuration on cifs side.
