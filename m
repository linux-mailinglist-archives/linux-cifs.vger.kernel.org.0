Agreed.

Good point!  Yes, we should handle both cases.

I don't like the idea of checking the version because the running kernel
might not have the expected patches.

Perhaps a new option would be better... I'll think more about it.

That's horrible, indeed.  I'll definitely make it readable in next
version.

IIRC, yes.
