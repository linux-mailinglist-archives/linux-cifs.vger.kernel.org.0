The reference to the primary channel there is to just get to the
session (and from there, the tcon) lists, which only hang off the
primary channel today. I'm not sure why this choice was made by
Aurelien originally, but that is how it can be fixed with minimal
changes today.
Ideally, each channel should point to the session list (taking the
necessary reference), and hence the tcons.

Also, we should be able to share connections between sessions. Today,
the secondary channels are used exclusively by one session.
I plan to get to that next.
