The 2) part is not really documented and is more complex than it
seems. We know how the SID are created but not the actual ACL/ACE for
each SID. I've almost completely reversed engineered it (except for the
one bit).

I've documented all here: https://github.com/aaptel/nfs-acl-test

The is one permission -- the S (SYNCHRONIZE) flag -- which doesn't seem
to be consistent in how it is granted/denied. But its purpose is not
clear on files/dir so it's probably irrelevant: we just need to
reimplement the unix_to_acl() func that I wrote.

I've contacted dochelp regarding this, and here is what they have to
say (note "UUUA" is Unmapped UNIX User Access):
