But mount point support which I was referring here is not POSIX
extension specific. It is already there without POSIX extension support
and available by Windows SMB server for at least 25 years in SMB1, SMB2
and SMB3. I checked them with older Windows version to verify it.

So any SMB server, with or without extensions, in any version, can
support it if it wants.

And I hope so that POSIX based SMB servers like Samba would support
correctly announcing of mount points over SMB and on POSIX systems it is
more common to have crossing mount points. On Windows systems it is less
common, but possible and it is already working.

Here were are talking about mount points which are represented by
special reparse point, plus on Windows registered in system itself.
Accessing it on Windows is very similar or maybe same as on Unix
systems = just access the path and it works automatically, no special
thing is required. And "smart" application can do "stat" (on UNIX) or
"getsomething" (on Windows; do not know exact function) to figure out if
is crossing mount point or not. It is really "mounted" filesystem on top
of another filesystem on both Windows and Linux.

Just creating such thing is different -- but this is not important here
as over network protocol we are not creating new mount points, just
accessing existing.
