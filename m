Steve, thank you for testing. I will do some other my own tests too.

For explanation, the function parse_reparse_point() is called by
reparse_info_to_fattr() and then return value from
reparse_info_to_fattr() is checked against -EOPNOTSUPP for handling name
surrogate reparse points. This logic was added in the commit
b587fd128660 ("cifs: Treat unhandled directory name surrogate reparse
points as mount directory nodes").

So this code in reparse_info_to_fattr() requires to know if the reparse
point was handled by the parse_reparse_point() function or not. Hence
reverting commit cad3fc0a4c8c ("cifs: Throw -EOPNOTSUPP error on
unsupported reparse point type from parse_reparse_point()") would cause
that the above logic stop working.

To fix both problems, the one reported by Junwen about unsupported
OneDrive reparse point, and the name surrogate reparse points, I'm
proposing in my change to "mask" the -EOPNOTSUPP not in the called
parse_reparse_point() function but instead in the caller
reparse_info_to_fattr().

During writing b587fd128660 and cad3fc0a4c8c I somehow forgot about the
case which cause this issue.

Linux SMB client should not filter out unknown/unhandled reparse points.
Reparse points are processed by the SMB server (with few exceptions for
UNIX special files).

In the attachment I'm sending the patch, now with the commit message and
Fixes lines.

Subject: [PATCH] cifs: Ensure that all non-client-specific reparse points are
 processed by the server
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Generally, reparse points are processed by the SMB server during the
SMB OPEN request.

But there are few reparse points which do not have OPEN-like meaning for
the SMB server and has to be processed by the SMB client. Those are
symlinks and special files (fifo, socket, block, char).

For Linux SMB client, it is required to process also name surrogate reparse
points as they represent another entity on the SMB server system. Linux
client will mark them as separate mount points.

So, after processing the name surrogate reparse points, clear the
-EOPNOTSUPP error code returned from the parse_reparse_point() to let SMB
server to process reparse points.

And remove printing misleading error message "unhandled reparse tag:" as
reparse points are handled by SMB server and hence unhandled fact is normal
operation.

Fixes: cad3fc0a4c8c ("cifs: Throw -EOPNOTSUPP error on unsupported reparse point type from parse_reparse_point()")
Fixes: b587fd128660 ("cifs: Treat unhandled directory name surrogate reparse points as mount directory nodes")
