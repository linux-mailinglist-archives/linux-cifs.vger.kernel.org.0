Sure! Have replied to you. Thank you very much for sharing!

If anybody resting cifs or I know that the expected setup and result of
every tests for you developers, it will save much time of investigation
and report false alarms.

After several months working on cifs, I've got a feeling that cifs is
much different from other Linux filesystems. Maybe because of Windows
or the SMB protocols. I'm wondering that xfstests which is a typical
testsuite for Unix/Linux filesystems, maybe is not that suitable for
cifs. I agree with Steve that there are hundreds of tests suitable.
If, only if, :) if we could know how MS testing NTFS or SMB protocols,
would that help or more suitable?


Thanks!
