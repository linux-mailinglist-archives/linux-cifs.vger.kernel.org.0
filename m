Ugh. You are very right.

It would be good to just change the rules - I get the feeling nobody
actually depended on them anyway because they were _so_ esoteric.

You're right, that "page_has_private()" is really really nasty.

The comment is, I think, the traditional usage case, which used to be
about page->buffers. Obviously these days it is now about
page->private with PG_private set, pointing to buffers
(attach_page_private() and detach_page_private()).

But as you point out:

Could we just remove the PG_private_2 thing in this context entirely,
and make the rule be that

 (a) PG_private means that you have some local private data in
page->private, and that's all that matters for the "freeable" thing.

 (b) PG_private_2 does *not* have the same meaning, and has no bearing
on freeability (and only the refcount matters)

I _)think_ the btrfs behavior is to only use PagePrivate2() when it
has a reference to the page, so btrfs doesn't care?

I think fscache is already happy to take the page count when using
PG_private_2 for locking, exactly because I didn't want to have any
confusion about lifetimes. But this "page_has_private()" math ends up
meaning it's confusing anyway.

btrfs people? What are the semantics for PG_private_2? Is it just a
flag, and you really don't want it to have anything to do with any
page lifetime decisions? Or?
