If you think that the disconnects are due to timeouts accessing files
on offline storage you can also try mounting with the "hard" mount
option.  The mount parm "echo_interval" can be also increased to make
it less likely that we give up on an unresponsive server (it defaults
to 60 seconds and can set to maximum of "echo_interval=600" ie 600
seconds).

There were many fixes relating to crediting and reconnection that went
in almost a year ago, but would not be in an older kernel like 4.15
unless Ubuntu backported them.   Fortunately, Ubuntu makes it very
easy to test if the fix is in a newer kernel by installing (as a test)
a newer kernel on your client for doing an experiment like this (see
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds).

If after installing a more recent mainline kernel as a quick test, if
you don't see the reconnect problem, this would make it easier to ask
Ubuntu to backport the various reconnect fixes marked for stable that
went in late last year (or you could continue to use the more recent
kernel).

Also note that it is possible with dynamic tracing now in cifs.ko to
do easier tracing of reconnect events (or all cifs events "trace-cmd
record -e cifs") which can sometimes help narrow down the cause.
Reconnect statistics are also updated in /proc/fs/cifs/Stats
