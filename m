But this is something totally different thing.

Here you are referring to the behavior of Samba server, which interprets
symlink node stored on local filesystem named e.g. "link1" pointing to
target relative file name 'msdfs:srv1\share,srv2\share' specially.

Calling "ln -s 'msdfs:srv1\share,srv2\share' link1" is perfectly fine on
the ext4 filesystem. It creates a relative symlink to the specified
file.

And if you call "echo test > 'msdfs:srv1\share,srv2\share'" then it would
world correctly and "cat link1" will print "test".

The 'msdfs:srv1\share,srv2\share' is a valid POSIX path and it is stored
on the local Linux filesystem. So I do not see anything wrong with it or
reason why local filesystem should disallow creating such symlink or why
would realink() should fail on such node.


That example has nothing with symlinks stored on NTFS-compatible
filesystems which has ability to store symlinks pointing to non-POSIX
NT object model paths.

Here the issue is with symlink target locations which are coming from
the remote NT server and are pointing to location which cannot be
directly represented by the Linux system. The translation needs to be
done in both directions and reversible. Otherwise moving the file or
symlink from cifs to ext4 and back would damage the file or symlink.

I agree that above is not the best idea, but I wrote at least something
as an idea as I do not know how it could be solved in better way.

And I do not see how it could be resolved by cifs.ko somehow
automatically. I'm not sure to which you refer how it can be resolved by
cifs.ko. I understood you message as it could automount another share
and do the whole path symlink resolving in cifs.ko.

And I think that this is even worse idea than mine. Because that
automount means that symlinks pointing outside of the share would start
behaving like a mount point. Such thing can cause even a security issues
if not used carefully.

But moreover there is a big difference between symlink and mount point.
Symlinks are not resolved by filesystem itself (but rather by the VFS,
to ensure that all access checks are applied) and also moving the
symlink between filesystems should not break them. In this idea when the
symlink is going to be moved from smb share to e.g. ext4 local fs, then
it would stops working (if the path resolved is in the cifs.ko) as
ext4.ko would not be able to process special cifs.ko symlinks.

I though that for any debugging purposes these messages are useful.
Now I see that VFS level is printed always, so maybe the FYI level could
be better. Or do you really think that it is useless even for debugging?
