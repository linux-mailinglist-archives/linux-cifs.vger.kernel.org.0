I think your patch makes it better. I seem Close() that your patch now fixe=
s the leak for.


But there is still a leak in Open().
I just got one instance where I leaked one handle.

The log shows :
CIFS VFS: \\192.168.124.207 Cancelling wait for mid 25 cmd: 5

and the wireshark shows an Open() request/response for this MID but we neve=
r
send a Close() for the handle.
