Thanks for taking a look at this.

Yes, we read directly into pre-allocated pages. For direct IO we read
into pages supplied by the user and for non-direct IO (including page
IO) we allocate intermediate pages.

Correct. Regardless of whether offloading is used or not there is an extra =
copy.

Yes.

Yes - assuming no signing or encryption, we should be able to read
directly into the mapped pages. But I doubt many people use SMB2
without signing or encryption although there may be some use cases
requiring performance over safety.

Theoretically we may try doing this with signing but we need to make
sure that no one can modify those pages locally which may lead to
signing errors. I don't think today we reconnect an SMB session on
those today but we probably should.

For encryption, we do not know where read data starts in an encrypted
SMB packet, so there is almost no point to read directly because we
would need to shift (copy) the data afterwards anyway.
