Dropping Smb1 support for linux-serving would seem to be a reasonable
step, since I would be hard-pressed to find a client that still
only talked Smb1 (clients from XP-era).

I am more concerned about the more secure smb2 & smb2.1 dialects. 
I have heard there is a security difference even between 2 & 2.1,
though, I don't often see a breakout between 2.0(only)+2.1, with both
seeming to be lumped in under Smb2. 

So lets say dropping smb1 isn't an issue...

    Then would it be a problem if it is called something like
"smb2n3" so it can be readily understood to support both?

    It's just a small comfort issue, since 'smb3' really doesn't
seem to be very convincing about its smb2-support.

Likewise!
