Wait, let me find my Spock ears.

Faaascinating.

Obviously the backend is doing some kind of deferred allocation.
Assuming this is NTFS, have you tried an alternative? I guess I'd
also suggest asking Neal, if you can reach him easily.

If it is deferring the block decision, I'd be cautious about
implementing a workaround like launching a second query attributes.
There's little guarantee it will be always correct.

If you can establish that the client is doing the right thing,
personally I'd implement some sort of waiver. Maybe make it dependent
on the server and its FS type, even.

I looked at MS-FSA and it explicitly states the AllocationSize is
updated as part of processing every write. Section 2.1.5.3:

> If ((ByteOffset+ ByteCount) > Open.Stream.AllocationSize), the object

So this might be worth a message to dochelp.

Tom.
