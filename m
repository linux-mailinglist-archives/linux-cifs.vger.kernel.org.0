I think it is too late to stop alternate data streams from entering
the kernel. They, or their equivalents, are already part of the
kernel.
This discussion is more about how to unify these things and provide an
abstracted api that is common across all filesystems than each
filesystem having a unique way to access them.
Filesystems that have protocol support for this is NTFS (ADS), CIFS
(ADS), NFS4 (named attributes) and HFS (forks). there could be more, I
have not checked.
These four are probably the four most common filesystems in use today
(ignoring FAT) across all platforms so support for this type of
feature is pretty much uniquous.

I think what we want to do is to have a discussion across maintainers
of all these filesystems and see if there is desire to work out a
common API and featureset and how that API would look.
How that API would work and what it would look like is a question
worthy to discuss.
Solaris surfaced this feature via openat() but that is just one of
many possible implementations. A separate userspace library that
provides universal access to these streams using something else would
work just as well. The discussion should be on how probe interest and
work together to create a unified abstraction common across all
filesystems. Then later work on what exactly the kernel API to access
this would look like.

For use cases? Something as trivial as storing an icon for use by
graphical file managers would be a huge quality of life improvement.
Even better if it would be compatible with how windows explorer stores
those same icons.
