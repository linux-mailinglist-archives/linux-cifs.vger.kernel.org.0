I was also surprised that a couple of these weren't found by smbtorture,
although to be fair it is more focused on functional testing of the protocol
(and is quite detailed).  Most of my analysis of the code had been
focused on functional coverage, and protocol features (and removing
older less secure
dialects, which he did).

After lots of discussion about areas to review - we created this wiki
page to track some of the detailed security review ongoing:

https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Ksmbd-review

Yes - we Namjae, Ronnie, Ralph and others have had multiple recent discussions
 about the review and testing process, and some useful improvements
have been suggested.
At a minimum it will include a review of each of the key security
areas, and additional
tests added (I added a few functional tests yesterday, but more need
to be added, perhaps
using some of Ronnie's libsmb2 libraries that we used to repro some of
the security problems).

There are basically two types of tests run:
- xfstests from Linux to Linux (usually from current mainline cifs.ko mounted
to current ksmbd). These are largely functional tests, more at an
application level
- smbtorture is the Samba functional test suite, and is largely at the
protocol level,
to show protocol correctness.  There are a few security/overflow
related tests in
this, but more need to be added.  The smbtorture runs are automated in github,
the xfstest runs are semi-automated, but I have to manually trigger them.

The builders for xfstest 'buildbot runs use a Fedora VM on the client,
that is spun
up with the standard Linux 'buildbot' testing infrastructure, then the
kernel is rebbuilt
and replaced and then the Fedora client VM rebooted to the current
kernel (in the
case of the run you are pointing it is was running 5.15-rc2 with one patch
applied (see below). The patch was added (from one posted on lkml)
to avoid the build break in current mainline Linux.

That (adding additional functional tests for smb3 overflows, and
also it restarts a discussion about creating open source "smb3 fuzzing"
tools to help Samba and ksmbd both) ... that is a discussion I have
been having with others on the Samba team as well, some of
the security bugs could have been found with additions
to the "smbtorture" set of functional tests (which are hosted in the Samba
server projects).

> (Also, I see they're being run individually -- why not run the totality?)

You can't run the totality of xfstests (some are not applicable for
network fs e.g.) nor of smbtorture (some tests aren't applicable).

I completely agree with the importance of Coverity as, even if the majority are
'false positives' or not high priority - there are plenty that
Coverity points out that are not.
I have focused more on Coverity for cifs.ko than for ksmbd, but after
the security patches
are merged, it would be good to switch gears to that.

I am pleased with the progress that Namjae et al have been making
addressing the problems identified, but agree it is not ready for production
use yet, despite good functional test results - and testing events
(like the SMB3
plugfest next week) are going to be important, as well as the security reviews.
Fortunately the code size is manageable (25KLOC), and without legacy,
insecure dialects to worry about (SMB1, LANMAN etc.), unlike most servers,
the reviews should proceed reasonably quickly.

The current patch list which has been reviewed and tested so far (includes
fixes for some of the issues you mention) is:

ksmbd: add request buffer validation in smb2_set_info
743d886affeb ksmbd: remove follow symlinks support
3bee78ad0062 ksmbd: fix invalid request buffer access in compound request
18a015bccf9e ksmbd: check protocol id in ksmbd_verify_smb_message()
9f6323311c70 ksmbd: add default data stream name in FILE_STREAM_INFORMATION
e44fd5081c50 ksmbd: log that server is experimental at module load

But there at least five more under review and testing.  Namjae et al have been
very responsive.

Good news about these test events, which are held multiple times each year
for SMB, is that some of the companies participating in the past have run their
fuzzers against Samba (and now will be able to do the same against ksmbd).

There is some good news (relating to security), once Namjae et al get past
these buffer overflow etc. patches.
- he has already implemented the strongest encryption supported in SMB3.1.1
- he has implemented the man in the middle attack prevention features
of the protocol
- strong (Kerberos) authentication is implemented
- he has removed support for weak older dialects (including SMB1 and
SMB2) of the protocol
- he will be removing support for weaker authentication (including NTLMv1)

Any feedback you have on the security list identified in the wiki list
above, or other
things you see in Coverity or the mailing list discussions reviewing the patches
would be helpful.
