I was able to reproduce this leak.  I believe the attached patch addresses it.

I'm able to intermittently see a 'Dentry still in use' bug with xfstests 
generic/241 (what Steve saw) (the attached patch doesn't help with that). I'm 
still unsure what's going on there.

Subject: [PATCH] smb: Initialize cfid->tcon before performing network ops

Avoid leaking a tcon ref when a lease break races with opening the
cached directory. Processing the leak break might take a reference to
the tcon in cached_dir_lease_break() and then fail to release the ref in
cached_dir_offload_close, since cfid->tcon is still NULL.
