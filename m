Thank your for the pointers.

Ok, so I've been taking the time to look into cifs and ksmbd today. My
mental model was wrong. There are two things to consider here:

1. server: idmapped mounts with ksmbd
2. client: idmapped mounts with cifs

Your patchset adds support for 1.
Let's say I have the following ksmbd config:

root@f2-vm:~# cat /etc/ksmbd/smb.conf
[global]
        netbios name = SMBD
        server max protocol = SMB3
[test]
        path = /opt
        writeable = yes
        comment = TEST
        read only = no

So /opt can be an idmapped mount and ksmb would know how to deal with
that correctly, i.e. you could do:

mount-idmapped --map-mount=b:1000:0:1 /opt /opt

ksmbd.mountd

and ksmbd would take the idmapping of /opt into account.

That however is different from 2. which is cifs itself being idmappable.
Whether or not that makes sense or is needed will need some thinking.

In any case, this has consequences for xfstests and now I understand
your earlier confusion. In another mail you pointed out that cifs
reports that idmapped mounts are not supported. That is correct insofar
as it means 2. is not supported, i.e. you can't do:

mount -t cifs -o username=foo,password=bar //server/files /mnt

and then

mount-idmapped --map-mount=b:1000:0:1 /mnt /mnt

but that's also not what you want in order to test for ksmbd. What you
want is to test 1.

So your test setup would require you to setup an idmapped mount and have
ksmbd use that which can then be mounted by a client.

With your instructions I was at least able to get a ksmb instance
running and be able to mount a client with -t cifs. All on the same
machine, i.e. my server is localhost.

However, I need to dig a bit into the semantics to make better
assertions about what's going on.

Are unix extension supported with ksmb? Everytime I try to use "posix"
as a mount option with mount -t cifs -o //127.0.0.1/test /mnt I get
"uid=0" and "gid=0" and "noposix". I do set "unix extensions = yes" in
both the samba and ksmbd smb.conf.
