We have done a lot of work (with Ronnie, Aurelien, Pavel and others)
on xfstest automation.

As you might guess it is frustrating for two reasons:
1) updated xfstests can be flaky (as the tests themselves are updated,
they add subtle required features, or regress from time to time)
2) test automation can run into resource constraints (VMs trying to
run tests with less memory than might be optimal - especially those
run against Samba with "VMs inside VMs").

But the good news is that we have VERY good data on which tests pass
to various servers (just as noted, need to update the external pages)
and we should have even more data as we go through two weeks of SMB3
testing events in late September.

In general we want to test against all typical servers and have test
targets setup for
 - Samba (reasonably current stable) on ext4/xfs and Samba with btrfs
(which has various optional extensions enabled in the server)
 - Samba with POSIX Extensions
 - Windows (and against both NTFS and REFS server file system)
- Azure (Cloud0

But would really like to add test targets for other common servers and
in a perfect world would like to be able to have external test
automation pull our trees periodically to run these (similar to what
is done for the six targets above):
  - Macs
  - NetApp
(and any others of interest to the community)

Obviously xfstest has a few hundred tests which only make sense for
local file systems with block devices, but there are hundreds of
xfstests of value, and most should run on cifs.ko and we are working
through them but already have a very good set running.
