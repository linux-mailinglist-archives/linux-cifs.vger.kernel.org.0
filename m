That is a good question.  I should have made more clear that although
many servers support Change Notify prior to SMB3 dialect, we chose
to implement it in SMB3 (late 2012 and later dialect) to minimize testing
risks and since we want to encourage users to use SMB3 or later (or
at least SMB2.1 or later since security is significantly better for later
dialects than for SMB1 and even SMB2)

Change Notify is available in all dialects (SMB2, SMB2.1, SMB3, SMB3.1.1)
for many servers but for the client we just implemented it for SMB3 and later.
If you have a server that you want to support that requires
SMB2 or SMB2.1 mounts, I wouldn't mind a patch to add notify support
for those older dialects but I would like to encourage use of SMB3 or later (or
at least SMB2.1 or later) where possible.

Steve
