generally I would feel more comfortable using something (library or
utility) in Samba (if needed) for additional SPNEGO support if
something is missing (in what the kernel drivers are doing to
encapsulate Active Directory or Samba AD krb5 tickets in SPNEGO) as
Samba is better maintained/tested etc. than most components.  Is there
something in Samba that could be used here instead of having a
dependency on another project - Samba has been doing Kerberos/SPNEGO
longer than most ...?   There are probably others (jra, Metze etc.)
that have would know more about gssproxy vs. Samba equivalents though
and would defer to them ...
