Right. Work to support it is in progress, Need the time to complete it.

Right.

Thanks:)  I will update patch description.

Okay.

Yes, Because linux smbdirect client send one Buffer Descriptor V1 element:)
So there is no issue between linux smbdirect client and ksmbd.

smbdirect codes of ksmbd are referenced from the linux cifs client's one.
and we found that windows client could send more than one element later.
It is in progress. I want that ksmbd work RDMA with Windows over a
wider variety of RDMA NICs in the meantime.

Thanks!
