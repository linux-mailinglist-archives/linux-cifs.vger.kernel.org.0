I wonder why the choice of 5 seconds? It seems to me a more natural
interval on the order of one or more of
- attribute cache timeout
- lease time
- echo_interval

Also, this wording is rather confusing:

It's not a "previous" filehandle if it's open, and "can be used" is
a rather passive statement. A better wording may be "the filehandle
is reused".

And, "until oplock is held" is similarly awkward. Do you mean "*if*
an oplock is held", or "*provided" an oplock is held"?

Only the second part of the sentence is relevant to the patch. Also,
what about lease break?

What happens if the handle is durable or persistent, and the connection
to the server times out? Is the handle recovered, then closed?
