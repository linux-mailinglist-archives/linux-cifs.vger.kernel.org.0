I'll be reviewing the patches next week, but for now I can say +1.

We've been debugging this issue for the past month or so, and it's been
quite hard to understand/debug who was racing who.

The 'dentry still in use' bug seems to appear only for the root dentry,
whereas cached_fids for subdirectories sometimes can get duplicates, and
thus one dangling, where in the end an underflow + double list_del()
happens to it, e.g.:

(this is coming from cifs_readdir())
crash> cached_fid.entry,cfids,path,has_lease,is_open,on_list,time,tcon,refc=
ount 0xffff892f4b5b3e00
   entry =3D {
     next =3D 0xffff892e053ed400,
     prev =3D 0xffff892d8e3ecb88
   },
   cfids =3D 0xffff892d8e3ecb80,
   path =3D 0xffff892f48b7b3b0 "\\dir1\\dir2\\dir3",
   has_lease =3D 0x0,
   is_open =3D 0x0,
   on_list =3D 0x1,
   time =3D 0x0,
   tcon =3D 0x0,
   refcount =3D { ... counter =3D 0x2 ... }

(this is at the crashing frame on smb2_close_cached_fid())
crash> cached_fid.entry,cfids,path,has_lease,is_open,on_list,time,tcon,refc=
ount ffff892e053ee000
   entry =3D {
     next =3D 0xdead000000000100,
     prev =3D 0xdead000000000122
   },
   cfids =3D 0xffff892d8e3ecb80,
   path =3D 0xffff892f825ced30 "\\dir1\\dir2\\dir3",
   has_lease =3D 0x0,
   is_open =3D 0x1,
   on_list =3D 0x1,
   time =3D 0x1040998fc,
   tcon =3D 0xffff892fe0b4d000,
   refcount =3D { ... counter =3D 0x0 ... }

You can see that the second one had already been deleted (refcount=3D0,
->entry is poisoned), but the first one hasn't been filled in by
open_cached_dir() yet, but already has 2 references to it.

A reliable reproducer I found for this was running xfstests '-g
generic/dir' in one terminal, and generic/072 some seconds later.

(in the beginning I thought that a reconnect was required to trigger
this bug, but any kind of interruption (I could trigger it with ctrl-c
mid-xfstests a few times) should trigger it)

actimeo >=3D 0 seems to play a role as well, because things can get quite
complicated (unsure if problematic though) with a callchain such as:

open_cached_dir
   -> path_to_dentry
     -> lookup_positive_unlocked
       -> lookup_dcache
         -> cifs_d_revalidate (dentry->d_op->d_revalidate)
           -> cifs_revalidate_dentry
             -> cifs_revalidate_dentry_attr
               -> cifs_dentry_needs_reval
                 -> open_cached_dir_by_dentry


Anyway, thanks a lot for you patches, Paul.  Like I said, I'll be
testing + reviewing them soon.


Cheers,

Enzo
