tentatively merged into cifs-2.6.git for-next pending review and more testi=

Do you remember if there is a reference to  sections of the protocol
documentation that can help confirm some of the changes?

> Previous OpenNT/Interix versions had no support for UNIX domain sockets
> (and socket files), symlinks or possibility to create character or block
> devices (but they had block/char devices in-memory, returned by stat()).
>
> Microsoft NFS server up to the version included in Windows Server 2008 R2
> also uses this SFU-style format of special files when storing them on
> local filesystem. Later Microsoft NFS server versions (starting in
> Windows Server 2012) use new NFS reparse format, which Interix subsystem
> (included in SFU or SUA) does not understand.
>
> Even SFU-style of special files is old format, it has one big advantage,
> this format does not require any support on SMB/CIFS server of special
> files, as everything is stored only in the file content. The only
> requirement from server is support for system attribute. So this allows
> to store special files also on FAT filesystem.
>
> This patch series makes cifs -o sfu mount option compatible with
> SFU-style of special files, and so compatible with the latest SFU/SUA.
>
> Note that -o sfu is by default turned off, so these changes should have
> no effect on default cifs mounts.
