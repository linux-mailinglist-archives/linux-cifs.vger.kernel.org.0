Thanks a lot for the '/proc/fs/cifs/Stats | grep "Open files"' tip,
Steve. But it seems not working in my case(not crashing case).

I have an SMB server that is able to close handles from server side,
and if closed remotely I want to check from client side. I've done
several experiments:
1. CIFS client open, server side close
  -  both "/proc/fs/cifs/Stats" and "cat /proc/fs/cifs/open_files"
remain unchanged
2. CIFS client open, server side close, client side call "close"
function to check fd
  - "Closes" in "/proc/fs/cifs/Stats" changes "4 total 1 failed"    <-
1 failed due to server side closed?
3. CIFS client open, server side close, client side call "read"
function to check fd
  - EBADF returned while trying to "read", this is what I expect.  But
for dir handle and WR-only handles, which function should I use?

Regards,
Gefei
