Hi Tom,

Thanks for taking a look at this.
I was considering doing so. But was unsure if we'll still need a way
to do round robin.
Steve/Aurelien: Any objections to just remove the round-robin approach?

We will not be mixing traffic here. Channel bandwidth and type are
considered while establishing a new channel.
This change is only for distributing the requests among the channels
for the session.

That said, those decisions are sub-optimal today, IMO.
I plan to send out some changes there too.

min_in_flight is declared as unsigned and then assigned to -1.
I'm relying on the compiler to use the max value for the unsigned int
based on this.
Perhaps I should have been more explicit by assigning this to
UINT_MAX. Will do so now.
