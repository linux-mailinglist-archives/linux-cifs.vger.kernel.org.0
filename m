Thx. Is that patch something Satadru should test to see if it fixes his
regression?
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cifs/CAFrh3J9soC36%2BBVuwHB=g9z_KB5Og2%2Bp2_W%2BBBoBOZveErz14w@mail.gmail.com/

And if it does, out of curiosity: Is the patch considered to be too
invasive for 5.17 as the final is just a few days away?

Ciao, Thorsten
