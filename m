Hi Nate,

From the log messages that you provided, the server has responded with
STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED. So the server does not believe that the user has
the necessary credentials to access the share.
Assuming that you provided the correct password to cifscreds, does the
local user (who's running the cifscreds add share) have the
credentials to access the share?

If you believe that all these are setup properly, you could provide us
with the packet trace capture from the time the share was mounted to
when the access was denied.
That could help you give a better insight into what was requested (and
as what user?). If the traffic is encrypted, you may have to provide
the keys for decrypting:

Regards,
Shyam
