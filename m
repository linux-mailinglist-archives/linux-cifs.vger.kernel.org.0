If there are no allow entres, then the access will be denied.

The point of checking the DENY entries first is to make sure that a
mistakenly too wide entry will not allow
unintended people access.
Or, for use cases where for example you want ALL users access, EXCEPT
for a special group, like a group where all temp contractors are
members of.
It also makes it less likely to make mistakes since you are not
dependent on the ordering of the ACEs.

And you could then do this with an ACL such as this:
1, S-1-2-EVERYONE                                    ALLOW   READ
2, S-1-2-NOT_FULL_TIME_EMPLOYEES   DENY      READ

This is a pretty common way to manage ACLs in large windows shares.
You have one entry that gives broad access   then a sharper entry that
excludes people.


So for correctness in a client, you would need to always check both.
But, you could take shortcuts. After all, the permissions you return
to the application
are just "cosmetics" for the application anyway.
Every access you do will be evaluated and enforced on the server anyway,
so if you get this mapping wrong (which will happen because it is
impossible to map an NTFS security descriptor onto a posix acl
perfectly for every corner case)  the worst thing this will lead to is
for example that you told the application "here is the acl, the acl
says you can read/..."  but once the application tries to do so it
gets ACCESS_DENIED back from the server, which may surprise the app.

So, clientside, it is not strictly that important to get the mapping
when reading an ACL perfect.
Writing the ACL on the other hand, that is where things get a lot more
complicated. For that case it is probably best to never write the ACL
from posix and only do it from the windows explorer, you know what
actual permissions are set.


Aside from the ACLs and mapping the ACEs into a posix ACL, you will
also need to think about how
uid mapping should work.
In NTFS/SMB you don't have uids/gids  instead you have SIDs.
There is no standard way on doing this type of mapping and there are
several different ways to do so, depending on
requirements. Even samba itself has multiple different ways you can do
this. And none of them are better than the other. They are all
different and imperfect due to the underlying differences in security
model.
For unix/windows integration, deciding on how and which type of
mapping to use is often very difficult and something that takes a lot
of work and preparations to decide on.

So for the process of usermapping, you need a method to map a
user/group SID into a unix uid/gid. You could do this yourself by just
creating a persistent database between SIDs that you encounter and
just assign them new uids as you discover the SIDs.
You could also use the LookupSIDs call in the libsmb2 dce/rpc
implementation. This is an RPC to the server that tries to resolve a
SID into an account/group name, and then you could instead have a
database that maps between names and uid/gid.
An easier path would be to use winbindd or sshd and have the Linux
system joined to the domain and then winbindd/sshd will do this
mapping for you.
But then you have an external dependency with a sometimes complex
configuration you have to set up first.


Don't get me wrong. But usermapping and translation between NT and
Posix ACLs is very complex. It is well worth doing if you want to
but it is a massive project.
I would personally just do something very simple like :
1, tell the application that the permissions are 0777 for everything, always
2, tell the application that the uid/gid is the same as the current
process, always
3, hope that most applications will deal with it gracefully. Most will.

(This just because I have worked in the smb fileserver space for a
long long time and doing full usermapping and acl translation could
well be a multi-person-year project.)

They absolutely do. But they won't be setting these ACL for every
single file or directory.
From am admin standpoint you mostly set these controls on a directory
level and then flag the ACE entries to be inherited.
Those settings will then at runtime also apply to all files and
directories below that directory.

When reading ACLs from the server for an object, you will not have to
do these scans recursively, it is done for you.
So if you do a "get acl for /foo/bar/baz" then the server will check
the ACL for all three of foo, bar and baz and on demand compute
what the total ACL would be for baz, taking into consideration
inheritable ACEs from foo and bar.

Reading ACLs is a pretty expensive operation server side for this reason.
But it is rich   and very powerful.


Taking inheritance into account, it might not be uncommon for the
resulting ACL for files in a large environment to have hundreds or
even thousands of ACE entries.
