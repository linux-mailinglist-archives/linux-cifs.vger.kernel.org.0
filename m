I'm not sure what is doing "chmod 0444 dir". It is setting SMB/NT
read-only attribute?

If yes then FILE_DISPOSITION_IGNORE_READONLY_ATTRIBUTE sounds like can
be something useful.


But anyway, I think that such bug could be fixed by sending SMB2
compound of following SMB2 commands:
* CREATE with DELETE desired access without DELETE_ON_CLOSE
* SET_INFO with clearing READ_ONLY attribute
* SET_INFO with setting DELETE_PENDING
* SET_INFO with setting READ_ONLY attribute
* CLOSE

CREATE with DELETE_ON_CLOSE fails on object with READ_ONLY attr, so
CREATE(open) has to be called without it. First SET_INFO will try to
remove the protection, to allow second SET_INFO to set DELETE_PENDING
flag. In case setting of it will fail, the third SET_INFO will restore
the protection.

Has SMB2 something like transaction support? NT kernel and its NTFS
subsystem provides transaction FS operations for applications. And I
think that Cygwin is using those FS transactions for race-free
implementation of removing file with read-only attribute.
