lease/oplock acks, we should change the reserved count altogether.

I think there could be some value in sending multiple lease break
responses (ie allow oplock credits to be a few more than 1), but my
main reasoning for this was to pick some number that was "safe"
(allowing 10 oplock/lease-break credits while in flight count is
non-zero is unlikely to be a problem) and would be unlikely to change
existing behavior.

My thinking was that today's code allows oplock credits to be above 1
(and keep growing in the server scenario you noticed) while multiple
requests continue to be in flight - so there could potentially be a
performance benefit during this period of high activity in having a
few lease breaks in flight at one time and unlikely to hurt anything -
but more importantly if we change the code to never allow oplock/lease
credits to be above one we could (unlikely but possible) have subtle
behavior changes that trigger a bug (since we would then have cases to
at least some servers where we never have two lease breaks in flight).
It seemed harmless to set the threshold to something slightly more
than one (so multiple lease breaks in flight would still be possible
and thus behavior would not change - but risk of credit starvation is
gone).    If you prefer - I could pick a number like 2 or 3 credits
instead of 10.  My intent was just to make it extremely unlikely that
any behavior would change (but would still fix the possible credit
starvation scenario) - so 2 or 3 would also probably be fine.
