Sure, I agree. Again, this could also be worked out in my proposal (I
haven't touched much besides README yet though).
For the missing stuff, e.g. manpages, we can also implement them the git
way, like "man 1 ksmbdctl" vs "man 1 ksmbdctl-share", where the former
would mention the latter, but only briefly and then indicate that a
sub-manpage exists for that command.

Yes, I've implemented it exactly that way:

share/share_admin.h:
void share_usage(ksmbd_share_cmd cmd);
int share_cmd(int argc, char *argv[]);

user/user_admin.h:
void user_usage(ksmbd_user_cmd cmd);
int user_cmd(int argc, char *argv[]);

daemon/daemon.h:
void daemon_usage(ksmbd_daemon_cmd cmd);
int daemon_cmd(int argc, char *argv[]);

The *_usage() functions were something I was preparing to accomodate the
new command abstraction I mentioned earlier, but I still haven't got to
finish. I wanted to get this unification approved first.

At daemon_process_start(), I did:

...
if(prctl(PR_SET_NAME, "ksmbd-daemon\0", 0, 0, 0);
	pr_info("Can't set program name: %s\n", strerr(errno));
...

which TBH I'm not sure is good enough. Alternatives/opinions are
welcome.
