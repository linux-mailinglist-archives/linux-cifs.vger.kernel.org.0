Presumably the attempt to close a file (from the Linux client) which
the server has force closed on their side, would lead to
/proc/fs/cifs/Stats logging an error on close.   It is an unusual
situation to have a server force closed a handle in such a way that it
would return an error on an attempt by an SMB3 client to use it (more
typical would be for a resource constrained server to expire the
session and let the client reconnect its open handles as needed).

To test use of directory handles after a force close of server handles
(ie for the unusual case where the file handle is force closed on the
server side through some tool, but the client has the file still
open), you could try something similar to the "PASSTHRU_FSCTL" for
doing a query info (see e.g. the function fsctlgetobjid in cifs-utils
package smbinfo.c) after you have left a directory handle open long
enough for your force close on the server side to be done.

This is an unusual scenario though where you want to have the server
throw away state (network file handles open on a connection) without
killing the smb session (in which case the client can reconnect
transparently).
