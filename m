I've always preferred the UNIX way: one app does one thing and one thing only.
This is why we have cp and mv, mkdir and touch, etc. we don't have a
single vfs-ctl
app that takes several hundred arguments and whose man page is basically a
small book (20+ pages long). This way we:
- keep manpages short and clear
- avoid params conflicts and ambiguity
- keep eggs in different baskets

Git is a tricky example. But OK. If this will be implemented in a way
git builtins are
implemented - then I don't see why we would not want this.

git builtins are basically independent apps (they even link all
commands into separate
binaries and then symlink them during installation) which have been
rewritten from either
shell/perl scripts or standalone binaries in C and put into builtins/
directory, for performance
reasons. There are still a handful of shell/perl and standalone
binaries - e.g. git-remote-ftp,
git-http-fetch, git-http-push, ./git-bisect is a shell script. And so on.

Built-in commands are, basically, independent binaris that have a
common ancestor with the
only exception that git does not fork/exec them (not all of them).
They even have entry points
that resemble main() - they take "int argc, const char **argv" - and
git passes its argc and argv
down to built-ins.

Schematically

git: main(int argc, char **argv) {
      builtin = lookup_builtin_command();
      builtin->run(argc, argv);
}

Is this what you have in mind?

>   # ksmbdctl daemon start

Is this going to fork ksmb daemon? Otherwise this looks confusing. I'd
say that ksmbd daemon
needs to have a different name that will clearly show that it's a ksmb
daemon, not the "control"
tool that adds shares and deletes users.
