I 100% agree.

But, actually, that's the whole point of my commit. I just wanted to add
what will work with mount.cifs on a FIPS compliant environment. Nothing
else.

Stating "don't use SMB1" (either FIPS or not) could come in a different
commit.

(Personally, I would've nuked all SMB1 from the kernel altogether :P)

Again, I agree. But I'd say it's up to FIPS to mandate that. Even
because their requirements only cover the crypto modules, not
filesystems and/or versions as a whole AFAIK.

But that's on a product (OS) level. We're preparing similar
documentation for SUSE as well, for example.

And again, I also agree. My intent was to rather have specified in the
docs what's supported in FIPS mode. Suggesting/enforcing a particular
version or security mode was out of scope of my patch.
