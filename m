In addition, If negotiation received no response, there are two possible
actions:
1. server_unresponsive may trigger reconnecting again and return true.
2. server_unresponsive may return false and client falls back to
CifsNeedNegotiate state and trigger reconnecting in SMB2_echo.

There two conditions are similar to the stage when first mounting to
cifs server.
