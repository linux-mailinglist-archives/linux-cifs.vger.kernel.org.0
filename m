Would quic_server_handshake() call setsockopt()?

Ok, but that would mean all application need to be aware of each other,
but it would be possible and socket fds could be passed to other
processes.

Ok, when the kernel already decrypts it could already
look find the ALPN. It doesn't mean it should do the full
handshake, but parse enough to find the ALPN.

But I don't yet understand how the kernel gets the key to
do the initlal decryption, I'd assume some call before listen()
need to tell the kernel about the keys.

I was just brainstorming for ideas...
