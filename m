We have several different targets, which maps to the local.config for
xfstests so for every single test we run
we also specify the different targets to run that for.

Here is an example:
all_tests =3D [
        [ "cifs/100", "smb3azureseal"],
        [ "cifs/101", "smb3multiuser"],
        [ "generic/001", "smb3sign", "smb3"],
        [ "generic/002", "smb3", "smb3sign", "smb21", "smb3samba"],
        [ "generic/005", "smb3", "smb21", "smb3samba", "smb3sambabtrfs"],
        [ "generic/006", "smb3"],
        [ "generic/007", "smb3"],
        [ "generic/010", "smb3"],
        [ "generic/011", "smb3"],
        [ "generic/013", "smb3samba"],
        [ "generic/014", "smb3"],
        [ "generic/020", "smb3samba"],
        [ "generic/023", "smb3samba"],
        [ "generic/024", "smb3", "smb3samba"],
        [ "generic/028", "smb3", "smb3samba"],
...


The first argument is which xfstest to run and the remainder of the
arguments are a list of which local.config.* files to use.
That way we can run a test against different servers and also
different configurations.
I try to keep the target names meaningful, so

"smb3" just means a basic smb3   windows 2016 server running in a vm
"smb3samba" is just a generic smb3 server with samba.
etc etc.


We started doing this upstream about a year ago which is when I
started setting it up
and now I am honest but since we do this for every pull request we
send to linus,
we have SIGNIFICANTLY increased the quality of cifs.ko.

We run quite a lot of tests nowadays and I always try to remind Steve
to "please put a link to the buildbot result in the pull request"
to bring awareness to our buildbot.

For upstream, here is the most recent test:
http://smb3-test-rhel-75.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com/#/builders/2/bui=
lds/249

cifs-testing is the most generic test target. We also have specific
targets that are just for Azure, and other targets, but the aim is
that the canonical cifs-target tests will all pass before we pass a
pull request onto linus.


Please contact me directly if you want more info about the buildbot. I
have one setup internally at rh too that runs many, but not all, the
tests we run upstream.
Any help to maintain and expand the tests are super welcome.
