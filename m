This is good to know. However, since the SMB protocol explicitly calls
for enumeration of all network interfaces on the server host,
including their RDMA capabilities, I believe this is a sensible
exception to the layering rule. Or is there anyway else to do this
enumeration from the kernel space?

Or we can give up implementing the full spec of the SMB protocol and
call for explicit configuration from user space on how to respond to
the IOCTL requests in question. Which one looks more sensible to you?
