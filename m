Yeah, I think this is really important, and especially for bug fixing:
if a bug gets fixed in protocol or filesystem handling, there needs to
be a test to go with it. Without that, no one can say with a straight
face that it is actually fixed. It's just a band-aid unless there is an
accompanying test that exercises the flaw to make sure the fix doesn't
regress in the future.

So, I think each of the recent fixes needs to have an associated test --
especially the path walking and buffer overflows.

Is there a "patch requirements" doc for doing reviews? I don't see
anything specific to the "on going" review process at the wiki. The wiki
just calls out a number of areas that need out-of-band examination
(which is great!) in the form of basically a detailed TODO list. But I
don't see an actual patch review process. Specifically, what things must
a patch author do before the maintainer will be happy to accept a patch?

Great! I'm glad to hear it. For those events do you build kernels will
full KASAN, KMSAN, KCSAN, etc enabled? There might be a lot of flaws
that wouldn't otherwise get noticed.

Sounds excellent -- have these received professional crypto review?
There are a lot of corner cases in crypto negotiation procotols.

Yay attack surface reduction! :)

Thanks for making these recent changes; I feel much better about ksmbd's
direction. I'll take a look through the Wiki.

Thanks!
