In case it is disabled for security reasons and server wants to announce
that it is "available but disabled for security reasons" rather than
"not support at all", then yes it makes sense to send the request and
let it fail with ACCESS error with all those cleanup related issues.
But in this case server should announce the support that it is available
for clients.

In Linux it is not only VFAT. It is also slightly modern exfat. And also
whatever is connected over fuse to userspace.

But generally this is not Linux centric, but rather generic to any other
implementations.
